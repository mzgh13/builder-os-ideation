for this venture idea: 'ideation-v2/ventureOS-summary.md' (see below for file content) 

i started doing some competitve research, and then come across a company doing something very close, although not quite, and i could tell we share the same philosphy although their current GTM is more towards integrators (didn't go vertical, a horizontal dev kit play). 

And here're the whole sites I scrapped except the api docs:
'comp/merge.dev' (see below for file content) 

help me to dig into these docs more and get every insight you can get that can help inform me of my own ventures, maybe to validate, maybe to deter, maybe to offer ideas, maybe to pivot away. also know that i got access to it already, and i don't see why i can't simply leverage that solution and go vertical, so it's not entirely a bad news by all means. at this stage i just need to look very deeply and understand how it works and learn everything i can from their own venture. help me to analyze and extract all the biggest insights and learnings that i can apply to mines (including any directions that i should fail fast and stop pursuing).

NOTE: the whole site is too big to fit into your context, so I intentionally moved all the blog sites & how-to articles out. You should still be able to see a list of them in the environment file list, and after your analysis please suggest any additional files you think would help by reading further.

  1 | # VentureOS: Comprehensive Ideation Summary
  2 | 
  3 | ## I. Genesis: From Universal SaaS OS to Focused Venture Launchpad
  4 | 
  5 | ### A. Initial Problem Diagnosis & Grand Vision
  6 | *   **Core SaaS Pains:** The B2B SaaS landscape is characterized by:
  7 |     *   **Fragmentation:** Businesses require numerous specialized SaaS tools, leading to complexity.
  8 |     *   **Vendor Lock-in:** Migrating data and workflows from established SaaS is exceedingly difficult.
  9 |     *   **Escalating Costs:** Multiple subscriptions (e.g., "$20 here, $20 there") aggregate to significant expenses.
 10 |     *   **Data Silos:** Each SaaS tool maintains its own data model and scope, preventing a holistic business view. For instance, HubSpot (CRM) lacks detailed product activation events from Mixpanel, LTV data from Stripe, or specific support ticket history from Zendesk that might indicate churn risk for a deal. Similarly, Mixpanel doesn't know the marketing campaign source or deal size. QuickBooks/Xero doesn't inherently link revenue to specific sales reps or marketing ROI without manual effort.
 11 |     *   **Native Reporting Limitations:** Each SaaS offers domain-specific reporting, unable to natively join and analyze data across functional domains at a granular, entity-resolved level.
 12 |     *   **Lack of a unified overall business entity data model:** e.g., Different systems use different concepts and IDs for key entities like 'customer' (HubSpot `contact_id`, Mixpanel `distinct_id`, Stripe `customer_id`), 'product', or 'deal', making manual cross-system reporting error-prone and time-consuming.
 13 | *   **Limitations of Existing Solutions (iPaaS - Zapier, Make, Tray.io):**
 14 |     *   **"Good Enough" for Some Cases:** Simpler integrations or one-way data pushes via tools like Zapier can be adequate for basic needs, and sometimes quite effective, setting a baseline for perceived value that VentureOS must clearly surpass with its comprehensive, deeper approach.
 15 |     *   **Cost:** Can become very expensive at scale (e.g., Zapier for 100k tasks; Tray.io's enterprise pricing).
 16 |     *   **Complexity:** Low-code can be harder than coding when fighting UI limitations for complex workflows.
 17 |     *   **Fragility:** Often lack strong data/sync integrity and robust two-way binding for data entities across SaaS domains; sync bouncing is a common issue, especially for complex or bi-directional needs.
 18 | *   **The AI Disruption & Opportunity:**
 19 |     *   Most established SaaS are a decade old, not built ground-up with AI; current AI integration is often a retrofit, alongside existing UX and tech debt.
 20 |     *   A radical view suggests SaaS could become redundant with a unified business data layer + AI as the ultimate UX. While extreme, this highlights AI's disruptive potential if the data layer can be "owned."
 21 | *   **The Initial "SaaS OS" / Meta-Platform Concept:**
 22 |     *   A transformative platform *underneath* individual SaaS products, serving as a unifying data layer.
 23 |     *   **Aimed to provide:**
 24 |         1.  A consistent concept of key business entities (e.g., "customer," "product," "deal") and their relationships across all connected SaaS.
 25 |         2.  Elimination of data silos, enabling cross-domain data access and workflows.
 26 |         3.  A powerful data layer consumable raw (BaaS for devs) or via polished UX (vertical solutions or builder ecosystem).
 27 |         4.  Superior AI use cases leveraging the unified data and semantic clarity.
 28 |         5.  A path towards eventually mitigating vendor lock-in by potentially offering alternative, more efficient workflows or functionalities.
 29 |     *   **Technical Pillars Envisioned:**
 30 |         *   **Unified Business Object Model (UBOM):** A common semantic model for business entities. Initial thought: start small, focus on essentials for initial integrations, allow vendor-specific extensions, evolving iteratively. Not necessarily a formal standard upfront, but a useful internal construct.
 31 |         *   **Robust Bi-Directional Sync Engine:** The core IP, tackling the hard problems of conflict resolution, data integrity, idempotency, and state management across disparate APIs. LLMs were seen as a potential accelerator for developing this complex engine and the necessary connectors.
 32 |         *   **Connectors:** A mix of build (for core, using native client SDKs) and buy (e.g., proxying Tray.io or Zapier initially) to overcome the integration hurdle. LLMs to significantly speed up the development of proprietary connectors.
 33 | 
 34 | ### B. Critical Assessment & The Sobering Realities of the Grand Vision
 35 | *   **Immense Technical Complexity:**
 36 |     *   **"Perfect" Two-Way Sync:** Described as a "Herculean task" and "semantic hell." Conflict resolution, atomicity, idempotency, API-specific quirks, rate limits, error handling, and state management across N systems are extraordinarily difficult. Liability for data corruption is enormous.
 37 |     *   **UBOM Universality:** Defining a truly universal UBOM that accommodates all SaaS customization (custom fields, varying semantics for "customer") is incredibly challenging, risking either a lowest-common-denominator model or unmanageable complexity.
 38 | *   **High Cost & Resource Drain:** Building and *maintaining* numerous robust connectors and a sophisticated sync engine is massively expensive and resource-intensive.
 39 | *   **Market & Trust Barriers:**
 40 |     *   Gaining business trust for deep, write-access to core operational systems (CRM, ERP, Finance) is a monumental hurdle.
 41 |     *   SaaS vendors themselves aim to be platforms, potentially viewing a meta-platform as a threat rather than a partner.
 42 |     *   Existing "good enough" solutions (iPaaS, CDPs, Reverse ETL, DIY data stacks) mitigate acute pain for many, reducing urgency for a universal solution.
 43 |     *   A horizontal BaaS GTM can be difficult, lacking specific ROI demonstration without vertical focus.
 44 | 
 45 | ### C. The Strategic Pivot to "VentureOS" / "BuilderOS"
 46 | *   **Rationale:** To de-risk and find a more tractable path to market, the focus shifted from a universal solution to a targeted one: **an operational launchpad and intelligent co-pilot for new and micro-ventures.**
 47 | *   **Key Advantages of this Pivot:**
 48 |     *   **Greenfield Environment Focus (for an initial phase):** The thinking is that initially, provisioning new SaaS instances (or guiding their setup) would massively simplify integration, UBOM definition (it becomes an internal, controlled model), and sync logic (cleaner APIs, fewer legacy issues, controlled configuration). This focus on new setups is seen as an initial phase convenience to manage complexity and de-risk a first launch. The long-term vision explicitly includes supporting retrofit scenarios, allowing businesses to connect existing SaaS instances, particularly for those SaaS tools without extensive customization or overly complex custom field structures (e.g., "bring your own instance").
 49 |     *   **Targeted Value Proposition:** Directly addresses the acute pains of new founders: tool overwhelm, setup complexity, lack of early operational visibility.
 50 |     *   **Reduced Technical Risk:** Initial focus on read-only data aggregation via official APIs, with bi-directional sync as a future, selective evolution.
 51 | 
 52 | ## II. Core Thesis of VentureOS (Refined & Current)
 53 | 
 54 | VentureOS is the **operational launchpad and intelligent co-pilot for resource-constrained venture builders,** designed to deliver both immediate setup value and crucial ongoing insights necessary for sustained growth. This includes a surge of new builders empowered by LLM-assisted coding, first-time founders, solo/micro-bootstrappers, and side-hustle scalers. It achieves its mission by:
 55 | 
 56 | 1.  **Guided Setup of Curated "Venture Packs":** Providing opinionated, pre-integrated bundles of essential SaaS tools (covering core business operational needs) tailored for specific venture types (e.g., "Lean SaaS MVP," "Indie Creator Hub").
 57 | 2.  **Unified Insight Layer & Ongoing Value:** Aggregating data (primarily via official APIs and focusing on read-only access initially) from these tools into a central command center. This offers cross-domain reports and dashboards previously hard to attain, providing essential ongoing strategic insight that is a necessity for adaptation and growth, not just a one-off setup benefit.
 58 | 3.  **Actionable Intelligence (Evolving):** Starting with clear metrics and basic alerts. The roadmap includes AI-driven suggestions and an "AI co-pilot" for decision support. This will be approached pragmatically, understanding the risks and focusing on leveraging reliable AI capabilities as they mature to augment human intelligence. AI features are seen as a powerful enhancement built upon VentureOS's solid data foundation, which is key, rather than a speculative bet for the platform's core success.
 59 | 
 60 | ## III. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) & Market Context
 61 | 
 62 | ### A. Overarching Persona: "Resource-Constrained Venture Builders"
 63 | *   **Key Characteristics:** Time is their most precious asset; need to be capital-efficient; operate with a lean team (or solo); value speed of execution and learning; open to guidance and "best practice" defaults if it accelerates them; acutely feel the pain of context-switching and tool fragmentation.
 64 | 
 65 | ### B. Primary ICP Focus: "First-Time" Founders & LLM-Empowered Builders
 66 | *   **Profile:** Individuals or small teams, often technically adept (amplified by LLM assistance in coding), launching their first significant digital product/service (SaaS, AI-tool, sophisticated app). May aim for venture funding or substantial bootstrapped revenue.
 67 | *   **Pain Points:** Strong on product vision, often weaker on GTM/ops/finance setup. Overwhelmed by "business overhead." Need to show traction and manage resources effectively.
 68 | *   **VentureOS Appeal:** "Hit the ground running with a best-practice ops stack. Focus on your product; we'll help with the business scaffolding and give you the data to iterate."
 69 | *   **WTP:** Moderate, especially if clear ROI (time saved, funding readiness, mistake avoidance) is demonstrated.
 70 | *   **"First-Time" Framing:** Refers more to a *mindset* (open to guidance, less entrenched in complex pre-existing stacks, acutely feeling startup pains) than a strict biographical limitation. Includes experienced individuals launching ventures in *new domains* or adopting *new approaches*.
 71 | 
 72 | ### C. Secondary ICP (Freemium/Volume Strategy): Side-Hustle Scalers & Indie Hackers
 73 | *   **Profile:** Individuals turning a side project into a real income stream. Often bootstrapping, highly cost-sensitive. Launching simpler digital products, niche tools, or content businesses. High experimentation and project iteration rate.
 74 | *   **Pain Points:** Juggling day job + side hustle. Need maximum efficiency for limited time. Basic visibility into what's working.
 75 | *   **VentureOS Appeal:** "Launch your idea quickly and affordably. Get clarity on your numbers without learning 10 tools. Iterate fast. We also envision supporting the full lifecycle, potentially including a future marketplace for buying/selling successful micro-ventures."
 76 | *   **WTP:** Low initially; freemium model essential; potential for upsell if projects gain traction.
 77 | 
 78 | ### D. Market Dynamics & Rationale for Focus
 79 | *   **LLM Coder Surge:** The rise of LLM-assisted development is creating a larger pool of builders who fit these ICPs.
 80 | *   **High Experimentation/Failure Rate:** The frequent launch and failure of new ventures is an *opportunity*. VentureOS aims to be the go-to platform for each *new* attempt by making launching easy and informed, fostering loyalty.
 81 | *   **Market Sizing:** Significant TAM when considering anyone starting a new venture/project under resource constraints, including pivots and new initiatives within existing small companies.
 82 | 
 83 | ## IV. Product Vision & Key Pillars
 84 | 
 85 | ### A. "Venture Packs" / Templates
 86 | *   **Concept:** Curated, pre-integrated bundles of essential tools designed for specific venture archetypes (e.g., "Lean SaaS MVP," "Indie Creator Hub," "Freelancer Toolkit").
 87 | *   **Tool Curation Strategy:**
 88 |     *   **Opinionated but with Choice:** Heavily guide users towards a small set (1-2) of well-supported, pre-vetted SaaS options per core category, rather than dictating a single tool. Rationale: Balances simplicity with some user preference, ensures deep integration for chosen options. The "common stuff" for a given vertical/segment often has finite, preferred choices.
 89 |     *   **AI-Assisted Tool Selection:** The platform could use AI to guide users in choosing the most appropriate tools *within* a pack, or even the pack itself, based on their specific inputs and needs.
 90 | *   **Scope of Tools:**
 91 |     *   **Business Core:**
 92 |         *   CRM: Lightweight options (e.g., HubSpot Starter, Pipedrive, Folk, Attio).
 93 |         *   Email Marketing: (e.g., MailerLite, ConvertKit, Loops.so for SaaS).
 94 |         *   Payments/Subscription Billing: **Stripe (essential).**
 95 |         *   Bookkeeping: (e.g., QBO, Xero, Wave for very simple needs).
 96 |         *   Product/Web Analytics: **PostHog** explicitly favored for PLG-focused ventures due to its comprehensive feature set (analytics, session replay, feature flags) and open-source option, potentially over Google Analytics for certain use cases. Also consider privacy-focused alternatives (Plausible/Fathom).
 97 | 
 98 | ### B. Guided Onboarding & Provisioning
 99 | *   **Process:** A streamlined user experience for selecting a "Venture Pack."
100 | *   **SaaS Account Handling:** Facilitate account creation and/or authorization for the chosen SaaS tools **exclusively via official vendor APIs and OAuth flows.** No "backdoor" access. Users will still perform primary SaaS signup; VentureOS then connects and configures.
101 | *   **Automated Baseline Configuration:** Use APIs to apply sensible default settings to newly connected SaaS instances (e.g., standard sales stages in CRM, basic chart of accounts in bookkeeping, welcome email templates).
102 | 
103 | ### C. Unified Dashboard & Reporting (Read-Only Focus Initially)
104 | *   **Core Functionality:** The "Single Pane of Glass" providing a central command center for KPIs aggregated from all integrated tools within a "Venture Pack."
105 | *   **Cross-Domain Insights:** Pre-built reports and visualizations designed to answer critical business questions that require joining data from multiple systems (e.g., "Full Funnel View: Ad Click to Revenue," "Customer Journey Timeline," "Cohort LTV by Acquisition Channel").
106 | *   **Data Correlation Focus:** Enabling users to see relationships and patterns across different operational domains (e.g., impact of a new feature release on user engagement, support tickets, and trial conversions).
107 | *   **Rationale for Read-Only First:** Delivers immediate, tangible value (clarity, time-saving insights) while significantly de-risking the initial technical development by avoiding complex bi-directional sync challenges.
108 | 
109 | ### D. Actionable Intelligence & Ecosystem (Phased Evolution)
110 | *   **Phase 1 (Initial Focus):**
111 |     *   **Configurable Alerts:** The initial hypothesized focus would be on user-defined (or template-based) notifications (via email, Slack, etc.) triggered by thresholds or specific events across any integrated tool (e.g., "MRR dropped X% MoM," "Site Uptime Critical," "High-value lead completed onboarding funnel"). This phase would aim to validate core alerting functionality as part of the overall phased approach.
112 | *   **Phase 2 (AI-Assisted Insights):**
113 |     *   **Descriptive/Diagnostic AI:** Natural language summaries of weekly/monthly performance. Anomaly detection (e.g., "Unusual drop in feature X usage in PostHog"). Basic forecasting (e.g., cash flow, churn, sales based on pipeline).
114 | *   **Phase 3+ (Longer-Term Vision):**
115 |     *   **"AI Co-pilot":** More prescriptive advice (e.g., "Suggest A/B testing headline Y, as similar successful users see higher conversion"). *This is positioned as a significant potential value-add that leverages advancements in AI, building upon the core strength of the unified data layer. We understand the risks associated with over-reliance on nascent AI and will adopt a pragmatic approach, focusing on what AI can reliably deliver to augment user decision-making. The success of VentureOS is not dependent on AI breakthroughs; rather, AI is a complementary force multiplier for the robust data capabilities we provide, taking a free ride from general AI advancements.*
116 |     *   **Workflow Automation Suggestions:** Proposing automated actions based on observed patterns and best practices (e.g., "Automatically create follow-up task in CRM if a high-value lead experiences multiple errors in Sentry").
117 |     *   **Human Expert Ecosystem & Community:** Facilitating connections to advisors, mentors, co-founders, or specialized talent. Peer benchmarks (anonymized and aggregated). Forums for support and knowledge sharing. This builds a moat beyond pure technology.
118 | 
119 | ### E. Underlying Technology & Approach
120 | *   **Sync Engine:** Pragmatic and evolutionary.
121 |     *   **Initial Focus:** Robust and reliable **read-only data aggregation** via official SaaS APIs.
122 |     *   **Future:** Bi-directional sync to be approached cautiously and selectively, only for high-value, low-risk use cases where APIs are robust and supportive, or where it enables critical "killer workflows."
123 | *   **UBOM (Unified Business Object Model):** An **internal, simplified data model** used by VentureOS to normalize and make sense of data aggregated from the curated set of supported SaaS tools. It is *not* an attempt to define or enforce an external, universal standard. Its complexity is managed by the controlled environment of "Venture Packs."
124 | *   **Connectors:**
125 |     *   **Strategy:** Strategic **build** for core, deeply integrated tools within "Venture Packs" to ensure quality and control.
126 |     *   **Development Acceleration:** Leverage LLMs to assist in the generation of connector code and data mapping logic.
127 |     *   **"Buy" Strategy:** Using third-party iPaaS (e.g., proxying Zapier or Tray.io) would be a strictly temporary measure for non-core integrations or very early bootstrapping, not a long-term solution due to cost and control issues.
128 | 
129 | ## V. Value Proposition & Differentiation
130 | 
131 | *   **Speed to Operational Readiness & Continuous Strategic Insight:** Drastically reduces time from idea to a functioning, instrumented business, and provides continuous, actionable insights vital for growth, adaptation, and long-term success. This dual value (setup and ongoing) is core to VentureOS.
132 | *   **Simplicity & Reduced Cognitive Load:** Alleviates decision fatigue and technical burden around tool selection, integration, and initial configuration.
133 | *   **Integrated & Correlated Insights:** Provides a holistic, data-driven view of the venture's health, enabling better and faster decision-making.
134 | *   **Actionable Guidance & Operational Leverage:** Helps founders focus on critical tasks, prioritize effectively, and (eventually) automate routine actions.
135 | *   **Tailored for Modern "Builders":** Specifically designed to support rapid experimentation, multiple project launches, and the needs of the LLM-empowered creator generation.
136 | *   **Cost-Effective:** Especially when considering the founder's time saved, avoidance of costly mistakes, and potential for optimized resource allocation.
137 | *   **Key Differentiators:**
138 |     *   **vs. DIY Stack:** Eliminates the significant time, effort, and expertise required for users to select, integrate, and maintain their own disparate toolset and build custom dashboards.
139 |     *   **vs. General iPaaS (Zapier, Make):** While iPaaS can handle basic task automation and data pushes (and can be 'good enough' or even quite effective for certain isolated tasks), VentureOS differentiates significantly. It's not about being a 'templatized' Zapier. We offer deeper, pre-built, context-aware integrations tailored for venture launch stacks, a unified insight layer for crucial cross-domain analysis, and curated templates. Crucially, VentureOS aims for more technically sophisticated and reliable two-way synchronization where feasible (especially with tighter schema control on supported tools), addressing complex data coherence challenges. This focus on robust, integrated data and comprehensive insights, rather than just point-to-point task automation, is a core differentiator.
140 |     *   **vs. All-in-One Suites (e.g., Zoho One, HubSpot Suite):** Provides a curated selection of potentially "best-of-breed" or highly popular third-party tools (which users may already prefer or trust for specific functions), integrated into a cohesive operational view, rather than locking users into a single vendor's ecosystem.
141 |     *   **vs. Standalone Dashboarding/BI Tools (e.g., Databox, Geckoboard) or FP&A Tools (e.g., Jirav, Pry):** Broader scope covering the entire initial operational stack (sales, marketing, finance, product) plus the critical guided launch and setup component. It's not just about displaying data, but about setting up the systems that generate it and providing ongoing intelligence.
142 | 
143 | ## VI. Strategic & De-risking Considerations
144 | 
145 | *   **Phased & Lean Rollout:** The next step involves defining an initial focused offering, envisioned as one core "Venture Pack" (e.g., "Lean SaaS MVP") targeting a specific initial ICP (e.g., "LLM-Empowered SaaS Builders"). This would represent the first phase of a lean rollout.
146 | *   **Prioritize Read-Only Value:** Deliver exceptional, reliable dashboards and actionable insights from aggregated data before tackling the complexities of bi-directional sync or advanced AI.
147 | *   **API Dependency & Management:** Acknowledge reliance on third-party SaaS APIs; requires robust error handling, monitoring for API changes, and potentially fallback strategies or alternative tool suggestions if a key API becomes problematic.
148 | *   **SaaS Vendor Relationships:** Explore potential for partnerships (co-marketing, technical collaboration for better API access) or affiliate/reseller models with SaaS vendors featured in "Venture Packs." Approach as a channel that brings them qualified new users.
149 | *   **Monetization Strategy:**
150 |     *   **Freemium Tier:** For basic usage, perhaps one project with limited features/integrations, to drive adoption and gather feedback.
151 |     *   **Tiered Subscriptions:** Based on factors like depth of features (e.g., advanced analytics, AI capabilities), number of users, and potentially data volume/sync frequency.
152 | *   **Realistic AI Roadmap:** Begin with simple, rule-based alerts and basic AI-driven insights. Iterate based on user feedback and demonstrated value, ensuring AI features are grounded and genuinely useful. Avoid overpromising on "AI magic" in early stages; the core data layer provides the essential foundation, allowing VentureOS to responsibly incorporate AI advancements as they become reliable and impactful. We will heavily message our understanding of AI risks and our pragmatic approach.
153 | *   **Building Trust:** Paramount. Emphasize robust data security, privacy measures, and transparent data handling practices, given access to sensitive business information.
154 | *   **Community & Ecosystem as a Moat:** Long-term vision could include building a supportive community, facilitating expert connections, and offering anonymized peer benchmarks to increase stickiness and network effects.
155 | *   **Market Education:** Clearly articulate the comprehensive value proposition beyond just being a "bundle of tools" or a "dashboard." Focus on the "operational OS" and "intelligent co-pilot" aspects.
156 | 
157 | ## VII. Key Open Questions & Areas for Next Steps (Validation & Research)
158 | 
159 | *   **Validating Core Assumptions & Defining Initial MVP Scope - Next Steps:**
160 |     *   Conduct thorough research to identify and validate key underlying assumptions of the VentureOS concept, especially those that are not yet fully proven or are critical to the business model's success.
161 |     *   Perform in-depth analysis of potential target verticals and customer segments to understand their specific characteristics, operational maturity, and readiness for a solution like VentureOS.
162 |     *   Investigate the detailed workflows, existing tool stacks, and integration challenges prevalent within the most promising target segments to identify precise areas where VentureOS can offer maximum value.
163 |     *   Systematically validate the acute pain points experienced by these target segments, ensuring the proposed VentureOS solution directly addresses their most pressing needs and that they perceive significant value in it.
164 |     *   Based on the validated assumptions and deep market understanding, *then* proceed to define the scope for an initial "Lean SaaS MVP" Venture Pack, including determining the *exact* SaaS tools (and their specific tiers/versions).
165 |     *   Concurrently, define the 5-10 most critical cross-domain metrics, reports, and alerts for an initial dashboard that would provide immediate "wow" value, directly tied to the validated pain points and workflows of the target segment.
166 | *   **ICP Validation & WTP:**
167 |     *   Conduct further interviews/surveys with target ICPs (LLM-empowered builders, first-time SaaS founders) to validate pain points and the proposed solution.
168 |     *   Test willingness to pay for different envisioned service tiers and feature sets.
169 | *   **Go-to-Market Strategy:**
170 |     *   Identify the most effective and scalable customer acquisition channels to reach these specific ICPs (e.g., partnerships, content marketing, communities).
171 | *   **Technical Feasibility & PoCs:**
172 |     *   Conduct technical deep-dives and build Proof-of-Concepts for key API integrations within the initial Venture Pack (especially PostHog, Stripe, a chosen CRM).
173 |     *   Validate data aggregation performance, reliability, and the initial internal UBOM structure.
174 | *   **Competitive Landscape Deep Dive:**
175 |     *   More detailed analysis of existing solutions that offer partial overlaps, to sharply define VentureOS's unique positioning and defensible advantages.
176 | *   **Initial AI Feature Set Considerations for Phased Rollout:**
177 |     *   Defining the simplest AI-driven insight or alert feature for an initial phase that could deliver tangible, demonstrable value beyond basic reporting, to be explored as part of the phased approach.
178 | *   **User Experience (UX) Design:**
179 |     *   Conceptualize the UX for the guided onboarding, dashboard, alert configuration, and how AI insights would be presented intuitively.
180 | 
181 | This comprehensive summary encapsulates the journey of the VentureOS concept, from its broad initial ambitions to a focused, strategically de-risked proposition, detailing the rationale, target users, product vision, and critical next steps.

185 | # VentureOS: Ideation Expansion Supplement
186 | 
187 | **Date:** [Current Date]
188 | **Version:** 1.1
189 | **Status:** Internal Working Document
190 | 
191 | This supplement expands upon the original "VentureOS: Comprehensive Ideation Summary" by incorporating detailed insights and strategic refinements derived from subsequent discussions. It is intended for future reference to capture the full context of the evolved ideation.
192 | 
193 | ## I. Refined Target Segment Analysis & Prioritization
194 | 
195 | The overarching persona remains "Resource-Constrained Venture Builders." However, deeper analysis reveals distinct sub-segments with nuanced needs, necessitating a tailored approach, especially for the initial market focus and product offerings.
196 | 
197 | ### A. Primary Beachhead Market: "Pre-Seed / Seed Stage Tech Startups (Funded or Actively Seeking VC)"
198 | 
199 | 1.  **Rationale Solidified:** This segment exhibits high pain intensity (operational overhead distracts from product/market fit and traction), a high "greenfield" opportunity (setting up new SaaS stacks), moderate-to-high Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) when clear ROI is demonstrated (e.g., time saved, funding readiness), and high strategic value (prestige, quality feedback, community leadership).
200 | 2.  **Unique Needs & Alignment with "VC Taste":** Founders in this segment are often aware of, or need guidance towards, services and operational rigor expected by Venture Capitalists. VentureOS aims to be the central hub facilitating this.
201 |     *   **Cap Table Management:** Platforms like Carta or Pulley are non-negotiable. VentureOS will guide setup and aims for API integration to pull summary data (e.g., last round details, option pool status).
202 |     *   **Legal Formation & Diligence:** Guidance towards reputable startup-specialized law firms (e.g., Cooley, Gunderson Dettmer, Fenwick & West, Wilson Sonsini) or platforms like Clerky/Stripe Atlas for standardized formation (Delaware C-Corp is the standard). API potential exists for status updates or document access from platforms.
203 |     *   **Startup-Friendly Banking:** Emphasis on dedicated business accounts with banks understanding startup needs (e.g., Mercury, Brex) and offering robust API access for financial tracking.
204 |     *   **Professional Financials & Accounting:** Cloud accounting software (QuickBooks Online, Xero) is standard. VentureOS will integrate deeply. Guidance towards specialized startup bookkeeping services (e.g., Pilot.com, Zeni) or fractional CFOs as ventures scale.
205 |     *   **Payroll & HR Platforms:** Importance of using modern platforms (e.g., Gusto, Rippling) once hiring begins, for compliance and efficient management. API integration for headcount and payroll expense data.
206 | 3.  **"Venture Pack" Focus for this Segment:**
207 |     *   **Name Idea:** "VC-Track Launchpad" or "Lean Tech MVP Pack (VC Edition)."
208 |     *   **Core Tools:** Stripe (billing), PostHog (product analytics), a lightweight but scalable CRM (e.g., HubSpot Starter, Pipedrive), an email marketing tool (e.g., Loops.so, ConvertKit).
209 |     *   **VC-Specific Operational Pillars:** Default (but optional) inclusion/guidance for Cap Table Management and accounting software (offering choice between QBO/Xero).
210 |     *   **Guidance:** Checklists and educational content on legal setup, investor readiness, etc.
211 | 
212 | ### B. Secondary Target / Volume & Freemium Strategy: "The Builder Spectrum" (from Indie Experimenters to Micro-SaaS/Bootstrapped SaaS Founders)
213 | 
214 | 1.  **Rationale:** This broader group can drive early adoption (especially via freemium or low-cost tiers), provide high-volume feedback, and foster strong community engagement. They frequently start new "greenfield" projects.
215 | 2.  **Sub-segment Nuances & Tailored "Venture Packs":**
216 |     *   **Micro-SaaS / Bootstrapped SaaS Founders:**
217 |         *   **Needs:** Align closely with the core operational stack of pre-seed/seed stage (Stripe is essential for MRR, PostHog for product insights, lightweight CRM, email marketing). Additionally, they face challenges in the eventual buying/selling of their ventures, a pain point VentureOS aims to address in the longer term by fostering a community and potentially a dedicated marketplace.
218 |         *   **"Venture Pack" Focus (e.g., "Bootstrapper SaaS Kit"):** Similar core SaaS tools as the VC-track pack, but without VC-specific elements (e.g., no emphasis on cap table management for investors). Potentially highlight more cost-conscious tiers of recommended tools or offer simpler alternatives if viable.
219 |         *   **VentureOS Appeal (Lifecycle Support):** Beyond initial launch and growth, VentureOS aims to support the full lifecycle, including a potential future marketplace for buying/selling micro-SaaS businesses. This addresses a significant pain point in the ecosystem where such transactions are often cumbersome and lack a dominant, trusted platform. By nurturing a community of builders, VentureOS can earn the right to facilitate these connections, potentially incorporating vetted analytics vendors to enhance trust and transparency. This is a long-term platform play, but the value of a complete lifecycle vision can be an early draw for builders.
220 |     *   **Indie Experimenters (Simpler Digital Products, Side Hustles):**
221 |         *   **Needs:** Focused on rapid idea validation, minimal setup friction, often selling non-SaaS digital goods (ebooks, templates, small one-off tools).
222 |         *   **Tooling Preferences:** May prefer platforms like Gumroad or LemonSqueezy over Stripe for their extreme simplicity, built-in global sales tax/VAT handling for digital goods, and lower cognitive load for simple transactions.
223 |         *   **"Venture Pack" Focus (e.g., "Indie Quick Launch Pack"):** A freemium or very low-cost offering. Tools could include Gumroad/LemonSqueezy, Carrd/Popsy (landing pages), Tally/Typeform (forms), ConvertKit/MailerLite (basic email), Plausible/Fathom (simple analytics).
224 |         *   **Branding/GTM Consideration:** This offering might require distinct branding or a clearly separated GTM funnel from the more premium VC-track offering to avoid brand dilution or confusing the target audiences.
225 | 
226 | ### C. AI-Powered Ventures (Cross-Cutting Consideration within Tech Segments)
227 | 
228 | 1.  **Prevalence:** A significant and growing portion of new tech ventures, across both VC-seeking and bootstrapped segments, will incorporate AI.
229 | 2.  **Core Operational Stack Similarity:** The fundamental *business operational* SaaS needs (CRM, billing, foundational product analytics, email, bookkeeping) remain largely similar to non-AI tech startups. VentureOS core packs should cater to this.
230 | 3.  **AI-Specific Operational Considerations (Beyond MLOps/Dev Infrastructure):**
231 |     *   **LLM API Usage & Cost Monitoring:** This is a significant operational expense and pain point for AI-native companies.
232 |         *   **VentureOS MVP Approach:** Provide guidance, checklists, and recommend existing specialized tools (e.g., LLMetrics, Portkey) or native provider dashboards (e.g., OpenAI's usage reporting).
233 |         *   **VentureOS Future Potential:** Explore integrating summary LLM cost data (e.g., from categorized accounting transactions, or direct provider billing APIs if they become robust and accessible) into the unified financial dashboard. This could be a powerful differentiator, allowing correlation of LLM spend with revenue and other business KPIs.
234 | 4.  **"Venture Pack" Terminology & Inclusivity:** Pack names like "Lean Tech MVP Pack" or "Bootstrapper SaaS Kit" should be messaged as inclusive of both traditional SaaS and AI-driven product ventures. The tool curation (e.g., PostHog for versatile analytics, Stripe for flexible billing) supports this. Specific guidance within the pack can address AI-specific configurations or considerations.
235 | 
236 | ## II. Product Strategy & Vision Refinements
237 | 
238 | ### A. "Venture Packs": Flexible, Customizable & Intelligent Starting Points
239 | 
240 | 1.  **Beyond Rigid Templates:** "Venture Packs" are not fixed bundles but rather intelligently pre-configured and opinionated starting points.
241 | 2.  **Guided Onboarding & Customization:** A user onboarding wizard will ask key questions about the venture type, goals, and existing tools to recommend the most suitable pack. Users can then customize by adding/removing tools or selecting from 1-2 curated alternatives within each core category, balancing expert guidance with user agency and preference.
242 | 3.  **Strategic Tool Curation – Value Beyond Integration:**
243 |     *   **Discovery Value ("Product Hunt for B2B SaaS"):** VentureOS can introduce founders to high-quality, relevant, but perhaps less universally known emerging SaaS tools, acting as a trusted curator.
244 |     *   **Affiliation Revenue Stream:** Strategically including and promoting smaller, growing SaaS tools (where genuinely beneficial for the user and aligned with pack goals) can open up affiliate/reseller revenue streams for VentureOS.
245 |     *   **Partnership Opportunities:** This curation strategy can lead to deeper partnerships with SaaS vendors (co-marketing, better API access).
246 | 
247 | ### B. The "VentureOS Command Center": Unified Cross-Domain Insight Layer
248 | 
249 | 1.  **The Core, Enduring Value Proposition (especially for VC-Seeking Segment):** This is the "killer app" – moving beyond initial setup to provide a "Lean ERP" or "Startup Command Center" through aggregated, correlated insights across critical operational domains.
250 | 2.  **Key Data Domains for Integration & Insight Generation (via APIs):**
251 |     *   **Financial Accounting:** P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow summaries, key ratios (from QBO, Xero).
252 |     *   **Banking & Cash Management:** Real-time cash balances, automated burn rate calculation, runway projection, tracking of capital inflows (from Mercury, Brex).
253 |     *   **Equity & Corporate Data:** Key funding round details (date, amount, valuation), option pool status, incorporation milestones (from Carta, Pulley; potentially Clerky/Stripe Atlas).
254 |     *   **Revenue & Subscription Metrics:** MRR, ARR, LTV, Churn, customer segmentation, funnel conversion (from Stripe, CRM, product analytics).
255 |     *   **Sales & Marketing Pipeline:** Lead velocity, deal stages, CAC (from CRM, marketing automation tools).
256 |     *   **Product Engagement & Analytics:** User activation, feature adoption, retention cohorts, key user journeys (from PostHog, Mixpanel).
257 |     *   **Hiring & Payroll:** Headcount, total payroll expense (feeding into burn rate), cost per employee (from Gusto, Rippling).
258 |     *   **Operational Expenditures (OpEx):** Cloud infrastructure costs, major SaaS subscriptions, LLM API spend (identified from accounting, banking, or future direct billing API integrations).
259 | 3.  **Power of the Command Center:**
260 |     *   Provides a holistic, data-driven view of venture health.
261 |     *   Saves significant founder time spent on manual data aggregation.
262 |     *   Enables faster, more informed decision-making.
263 |     *   Increases investor confidence through demonstrated operational maturity and transparency.
264 |     *   Facilitates creation of "Investor Update Dashboards," "Operational Health Dashboards," and scenario planning (future).
265 | 
266 | ### C. Company Operations vs. Product Operations (VentureOS & the ProductOS.dev Concept)
267 | 
268 | 1.  **VentureOS as the Holistic Umbrella:** Designed to encompass both overall *company operations* (finance, HR, legal, sales, GTM strategy) and *product-specific operations* (product analytics, feature development lifecycle, user feedback loops).
269 | 2.  **Product Operations as an Integral Module:** Tools and metrics related to product operations (e.g., PostHog integration, dashboards for activation, retention, feature usage) are core components of relevant "Venture Packs" within VentureOS, not an afterthought.
270 | 3.  **ProductOS.dev – Strategic Asset & Future Potential:**
271 |     *   **MVP Stage:** Not a separate product launch. Focus on building robust product operations features *within* VentureOS.
272 |     *   **Future Use:** ProductOS.dev could become a targeted content marketing channel, a specialized landing page funneling users to VentureOS's product features, or, if deep specialization and UX divergence warrant it, a more distinctly branded experience for product-focused teams that still leverages the underlying VentureOS platform.
273 | 
274 | ### D. Guided Onramps, Checklists & Educational Content
275 | 
276 | 1.  **Essential for Comprehensive Value:** For services without direct API integration (e.g., selecting a law firm, understanding specific compliance needs) or to supplement API connections (explaining the *why* and *how* of setup, best practices), VentureOS will provide structured guides, checklists, templates, and educational content. This enhances the "co-pilot" aspect.
277 | 
278 | ## III. Strategic & Go-to-Market (GTM) Considerations
279 | 
280 | ### A. Phased Rollout & Initial MVP Focus
281 | 
282 | 1.  **Beachhead First:** The initial MVP should concentrate on one core, well-defined "Venture Pack" (e.g., the "VC-Track Launchpad") targeting the primary beachhead segment (Pre-Seed/Seed Stage Tech Startups).
283 | 2.  **Prioritize Read-Only Insight Value:** Deliver exceptional, reliable dashboards and actionable insights from aggregated data *before* tackling the complexities of widespread bi-directional sync or highly advanced AI-driven prescriptive features.
284 | 
285 | ### B. Brand Positioning & User Experience
286 | 
287 | 1.  **Unified VentureOS Brand:** Maintain VentureOS as the primary, overarching brand. It is broad enough to be inclusive yet aspirational.
288 | 2.  **Tailored User Journeys:** Implement a smart onboarding process to segment users based on their venture type and goals. This will allow VentureOS to present a more tailored UX, relevant "Venture Pack" recommendations, and appropriate language/guidance within the unified platform.
289 | 3.  **Deferring Separate Brands:** Avoid launching multiple distinct brands or websites for sub-segments at the MVP stage. Only consider this if significant brand dilution or unmanageable UX complexity arises from serving vastly different user needs on a single platform, and resources permit.
290 | 
291 | ### C. Realistic AI Roadmap
292 | 
293 | 1.  **AI as an Enhancer, Not a Crutch:** AI-driven features should be viewed as powerful enhancements built upon VentureOS's solid, unified data foundation, rather than being the sole basis for the platform's core success.
294 | 2.  **Pragmatic Initial AI Features:** Start with simpler, rule-based alerts, basic anomaly detection, and descriptive AI summaries. Evolve based on user feedback and demonstrated value.
295 | 3.  **LLM Cost Monitoring:** Given its significance for AI ventures, this remains a pragmatic area to explore for AI-specific value, initially through guidance and potentially later through data integration.
296 | 
297 | This supplement is intended to reflect the current, most evolved state of the VentureOS ideation, serving as a comprehensive reference for future product development, strategic planning, and validation efforts.

300 | # VentureOS: Ecosystem Expansion & Strategic Augmentation Supplement
301 | 
302 | **Version:** 1.2 (Supplement to Version 1.1 of "VentureOS: Comprehensive Ideation Summary")
303 | **Status:** Internal Working Document
304 | 
305 | This supplement details the strategic expansion of the VentureOS concept to incorporate a comprehensive content, community, and experiential ecosystem. These elements are designed to augment the core technical offering (the "operational launchpad and intelligent co-pilot"), enhance user acquisition and retention, provide value across the entire venture lifecycle, and create a strong, defensible moat. It is critical to note that while expansive, these ecosystem components are largely peripheral to, and supportive of, the primary SaaS product. They aim to amplify its value and reach, not dilute its core focus on streamlining venture operations through integrated technology. The inherent risks of such an expansive vision, such as resource drain if not meticulously phased or potential brand dilution if not carefully managed, are acknowledged and will be actively mitigated through strategic prioritization and execution.
306 | 
307 | ## I. Guiding Philosophy: The VentureOS "Hub & Ecosystem"
308 | 
309 | VentureOS positions itself as the **central hub for ambitious venture builders**, with the core technical product (SaaS integration via "Venture Packs," a "Unified Insight Layer," and an "AI Co-pilot") at its heart. Surrounding this hub is a rich ecosystem designed to support founders through every stage and facet of their journey. This ecosystem provides:
310 | 
311 | *   **Growth Levers:** Unique "stunts" and content to attract and engage users.
312 | *   **Value Augmentation:** Resources that provide utility even if a founder isn't immediately using or cannot fully utilize the core tech product (e.g., due to existing complex stacks).
313 | *   **Stickiness & Moat:** A community and knowledge base that fosters loyalty and differentiation beyond pure technology.
314 | *   **Lifecycle Support:** Addressing needs from pre-ideation through to scaling.
315 | 
316 | The fundamental venture thesis – providing an operational launchpad via curated "Venture Packs" and a unified insight layer – remains unchanged. This supplement outlines how a broader ecosystem can support and accelerate that core mission.
317 | 
318 | ## II. Core Ecosystem Pillars & Strategic Initiatives
319 | 
320 | These pillars represent distinct but interconnected areas of value creation that orbit and enhance the core VentureOS SaaS offering.
321 | 
322 | ### A. Content & Knowledge Hub: Establishing Authority & Delivering Actionable Insights
323 | 
324 | This pillar focuses on creating and curating high-value content to educate, inform, and establish VentureOS as a thought leader.
325 | 
326 | 1.  **Newsletter & Blog:**
327 |     *   **Purpose:** Primary distribution channel for all content; consistent touchpoint.
328 |     *   **Focus:** Tactical advice ("Tactics for Traction"), investor insights, operational excellence, founder stories, learnings from Venture Formula™.
329 | 2.  **Case Studies & Interviews/Podcasts:**
330 |     *   **Purpose:** Social proof, practical learning, showcasing success (including future VentureOS users).
331 |     *   **Focus:** Deep dives into operational setups, fundraising journeys (founders, VCs), expert advice (legal, finance).
332 | 3.  **Structured Learning ("Founder School," "Builder Workshops," "MasterClasses"):**
333 |     *   **Purpose:** In-depth knowledge transfer, skill development, premium community access.
334 |     *   **Model:** Tiered offerings – free/sponsored introductory content, paid deep-dive Masterclasses.
335 |     *   **Value Beyond Certification:** Focus on actionable skills and access to a vetted network/community of peers, rather than formal certification.
336 |     *   **Partnerships:** Co-develop with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for credibility and reach.
337 | 4.  **Venture Formula™ (Proprietary IP, Research Framework & Content Engine):**
338 |     *   **Purpose:** To systematically deconstruct and distill innovation patterns from existing ventures, serving as VentureOS's proprietary research framework. This underpins unique, data-driven insights and powers multiple content formats (playbooks, analyses, trend reports). It is a foundational *content play* that establishes thought leadership.
339 |     *   **Output:** Published playbooks (e.g., "YC Early Traction"), deep-dive pattern analyses ("We analyzed X companies..."), trend spotting reports, shareable infographics. The *learnings and patterns* from Venture Formula™ can inform and provide data for the "Idea Machine" (see below), but it is primarily a system for generating high-value, insightful content.
340 |     *   **Growth "Stunts":** Public analyses of accelerator batches, highly shareable reports derived from its findings.
341 | 
342 | ### B. Experiential & Interactive Learning: Engagement, "Wow" Factor & De-risking
343 | 
344 | This pillar aims to create unique, memorable, and practical learning experiences.
345 | 
346 | 1.  **VentureSim™ (Business Simulator & Real SaaS Tech Sandbox Angle):**
347 |     *   **Purpose:** 
348 |         *   **VentureSim Core:** Gamified learning, strategic sandboxing, innovative growth tactic, value for those not yet using the core SaaS.
349 |         *   **Real SaaS Tech Sandbox (Integrated Angle):** Allow users to test-drive VentureOS integrations and AI features with real (trial/dev) SaaS accounts in a simulated environment, providing a tangible preview of the core product's capabilities. This has strong synergy with the simulation concept and fits well within VentureSim as a feature or module.
350 |     *   **Functionality:** 
351 |         *   **VentureSim Core:** LLM-powered simulation of business scenarios (fundraising, market entry, crisis management), pitch practice, GTM testing.
352 |         *   **Real SaaS Tech Sandbox (Integrated Angle):** VentureOS populates connected trial SaaS tools with simulated data, showcasing its dashboard and AI features in action within the VentureSim environment or as a distinct module.
353 |     *   **Audience:** Broad appeal from indie hackers to VC-track founders.
354 |     *   **Deployment:** Lead magnet, challenges, potential licensing to accelerators/universities.
355 |     *   **Value (Sandbox Angle):** De-risks adoption of the core VentureOS product, builds trust, powerful AI feature demonstration, educational.
356 | 2.  **"Idea Machine" (Interactive Ideation Tool):**
357 |     *   **Purpose:** An interactive, lightweight tool for early-stage ideation support, facilitating brainstorming and curation of venture concepts. Distinct from, but can be *informed by*, the Venture Formula™.
358 |     *   **Functionality:** Users input keywords, market trends, personal skills/passions, or observed problems. The "Idea Machine" leverages LLMs for brainstorming assistance and can incorporate curated patterns or insights *derived from* the Venture Formula™ to suggest potential venture concepts, market angles, and initial validation questions. It is designed to be a practical, hands-on tool for founders.
359 |     *   **Value:** Helps overcome "founder's block," explores adjacencies, injects structured creativity, and acts as a direct funnel to downstream research and validation phases (e.g., Venture Research as a Service, ICP Simulator).
360 | 3.  **Venture Research as a Service (Deep Internet Research):**
361 |     *   **Purpose:** Premium offering for in-depth, AI-assisted market/idea validation.
362 |     *   **Functionality:** LLM agents conduct structured research based on user-defined parameters.
363 |     *   **Value:** Saves significant founder time, provides data-driven insights.
364 | 4.  **ICP / GTM / Pain Validation Simulator (LLM Persona Testing):**
365 |     *   **Purpose:** "Quick and dirty" proxy testing for validating target customer profiles, messaging, and GTM strategies before real-world engagement.
366 |     *   **Functionality:** Simulates interactions with LLM-generated personas to gauge resonance and identify objections.
367 |     *   **Value:** "Fail faster," refine ideas, surface blind spots. Clearly messaged as an *aid* to, not replacement for, real research.
368 | 
369 | 5.  **LLM Investor Pitch & Thesis Stress-Testing:**
370 |     *   **Purpose:** Stress-test venture thesis & investor pitches via LLM-simulated investor scrutiny; ideation validation, esp. for VC-track founders but could be helpful for any builders to stress-test their ideas (more when they are more ready to talk about it to the world, but could be a tool for earlier-stage ideation iterations too).
371 |     *   **Functionality:** Input pitch/thesis to LLMs configured as investor personas; receive critical feedback, questions, and weakness analysis.
372 |     *   **Value:** Scalable, confidential practice to strengthen narrative & anticipate tough questions before real investor meetings.
373 | 
374 | ### C. Community & Network: Fostering Connection, Collaboration & Opportunity
375 | 
376 | This pillar focuses on building a vibrant, supportive, and valuable network.
377 | 
378 | 1.  **Vetted & Segmented Community Platform:**
379 |     *   **Purpose:** Facilitate interaction, peer support, knowledge sharing, and networking within relevant founder groups.
380 |     *   **Structure:** Central platform (e.g., Discord, Circle) with vetted access. Clear channels for specific interests/segments (VC-track, Micro-SaaS, Indie, Ideation, etc.) to ensure relevance and reduce noise. Each segment treated as a premium, focused environment.
381 |     *   **Potential Public Funnel:** A broader, open "lobby" (e.g., Reddit) could serve as a top-of-funnel, with pathways to vetted communities.
382 | 2.  **Two-Sided Marketplace (Founders & Investors; Founders & Acquirers/Sellers of Micro-SaaS - Phased Approach):**
383 |     *   **Purpose:**
384 |         *   Connect vetted founders with relevant early-stage investors and vice-versa.
385 |         *   Facilitate the buying and selling of micro-SaaS businesses, addressing a current pain point in that ecosystem. This naturally extends from building a strong community of builders and can be enhanced by integrating vetted analytics vendors for due diligence. This is a long-term platform play, but teasing this value early can attract builders by showing full lifecycle support.
386 |     *   **Founder Value (VC Track):** Access to curated investor lists, potential for warm intros.
387 |     *   **Founder Value (Micro-SaaS):** A trusted platform for potential exits or acquisitions, streamlining a typically fragmented process.
388 |     *   **Investor Value:** Access to a pipeline of operationally-aware startups (due to VentureOS engagement), ATS-like experience for deal discovery and tracking via a dedicated investor portal.
389 |     *   **Acquirer/Seller Value (Micro-SaaS):** A dedicated, potentially more efficient marketplace with a community of known builders and potentially integrated due diligence support (e.g., via vetted analytics vendors).
390 |     *   **Phasing:** Start with curated lists/manual intros for investor connections. For Micro-SaaS M&A, initially foster community connections and content around best practices, potentially evolving to a more featured platform with tools for listing, discovery, and due diligence support as the ecosystem matures and VentureOS earns the right to build this.
391 | 3.  **Async Matchmaking Features:**
392 |     *   **Purpose:** Facilitate connections (co-founders, mentors, peers) with lower moderation overhead.
393 |     *   **Functionality:** Based on profiles, skills, interests; potentially integrated with "Idea Machine" outputs.
394 | 
395 | ## III. Strategic Considerations for Ecosystem Development
396 | 
397 | *   **Unified Entrepreneurial DNA:** While catering to different segments (VC-track, Micro-SaaS, Indie Hackers), the core content and tools often appeal to the shared entrepreneurial spirit. Funneling into specialized sub-communities maintains relevance.
398 | *   **Early Infrastructure, Long-Term Play:** Content and community are long-haul efforts. Early, lean infrastructure setup (leveraging LLMs for initial content generation) is beneficial, but sustained, high-quality execution is paramount.
399 | *   **Execution Bar for VC-Track:** Serving sophisticated VC-track founders demands A+ quality in content, insights, and expert engagement. Generic advice will not suffice. Initial traction might be easier with Micro-SaaS/Indie segments, building credibility for the VC-track offering.
400 | *   **Phased Rollout & Prioritization:** Resource-intensive elements like comprehensive courses or complex interactive tools will be developed iteratively, prioritizing based on impact and readiness. It's better to show less if quality isn't assured ("less, but better" initially).
401 | *   **Monetization Layers:**
402 |     *   **Core:** VentureOS SaaS subscriptions (for the "Venture Packs" and "Unified Insight Layer").
403 |     *   **Peripheral/Ecosystem:** Paid premium courses/workshops, premium tiers for advanced ideation tools (Venture Research Service), future marketplace fees, strategic and ethical affiliate partnerships (SaaS, legal, accounting).
404 | 
405 | ## IV. Positioning: The Hub for Venture Lifecycle Support
406 | 
407 | VentureOS remains, at its core, the **technical operational hub**. The ecosystem elements serve to support founders across the entire venture lifecycle and through various facets of need:
408 | 
409 | *   **Ideate & Validate Stage (Inspiration & Early Traction):** Idea Machine, Venture Research, foundational content, early community.
410 | *   **Learn & Prepare Stage (Knowledge & Readiness):** Founder School, VentureSim, peer learning.
411 | *   **Build & Operate Stage (Execution & Efficiency):** ***Core VentureOS SaaS product (Curated "Venture Packs," SaaS integration, "Unified Insight Layer" dashboards, core metrics, alerts, "AI Co-pilot").***
412 | *   **Connect & Grow Stage (Network & Scaling):** Marketplace, investor readiness tools, peer & expert network, scaling content.
413 | 
414 | This lifecycle and facet-based framing ensures that the core technical offering (Build & Operate) is central, while the peripheral ecosystem elements provide continuous value, attract users at different entry points, and enhance overall stickiness and differentiation. The goal is not to dilute the core offering but to create a comprehensive support system that makes VentureOS an indispensable partner for ambitious venture builders.

418 | # VentureOS: Comprehensive Strategic Refinement, MVP De-risking, and Path Forward
419 | 
420 | **Version:** 1.3 (This document supersedes previous informal discussion notes and aims to be a comprehensive, standalone reference for the evolved VentureOS strategy)
421 | **Status:** Internal Strategic Document
422 | 
423 | ## Preamble
424 | 
425 | This document details the strategic evolution and refinement of the VentureOS concept. It builds upon initial ideation (as outlined in "VentureOS: Comprehensive Ideation Summary v1.1" and "VentureOS: Ecosystem Expansion & Strategic Augmentation Supplement v1.2") by incorporating critical analysis, addressing identified risks, and outlining a de-risked, phased approach to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development and market validation. The goal is to create a robust, actionable plan that balances ambitious vision with pragmatic execution, ensuring VentureOS effectively addresses core founder pain points and establishes a strong market position. This document captures the full context of challenges, considerations, and strategic decisions made.
426 | 
427 | ## I. Addressing the Core Value Proposition: Demonstrating Indisputable & Differentiated Value Beyond "Good Enough"
428 | 
429 | ### A. Initial Challenge & Risk Context: The "Good Enough" Barrier & iPaaS Comparisons
430 | A primary concern identified was that early-stage founders, being inherently resource-constrained and often technically adept, frequently develop "good enough" solutions using free, cheap, or existing tools. This includes manual data aggregation, basic point-to-point automations via platforms like Zapier or Make, and reliance on native reporting within individual SaaS applications. Furthermore, the initial "SaaS OS" concept could be misconstrued as just a more complex iPaaS. For VentureOS to gain traction and justify adoption, it must offer a value proposition that is demonstrably and significantly superior and *differentiated* – often framed as a "10x improvement" – in areas like time saved, critical insights generated, operational efficiency, or investor-readiness. Simply being a "nice to have," marginally better, or another iPaaS variant would not suffice to overcome existing habits and the perceived utility of current workarounds.
431 | 
432 | ### B. Refined Value Proposition & Strategic Pillars:
433 | 
434 | 1.  **Pillar 1: Radical Time Savings & Reduction of "Tool Tinkering Tax" through Robust, "Not Fragile" Integrations.**
435 |     *   **Context & Problem:** Founders spend an inordinate amount of time not just on the initial setup of their operational tool stack, but also on the ongoing maintenance and debugging of integrations. DIY setups, especially those cobbled together with multiple tools or basic automation platforms, are often brittle ("fragile"). They break when SaaS APIs change, when data formats are inconsistent, or due to unexpected edge cases. This "tool tinkering tax" is a constant drain on a founder's most precious resource: time. This pain point directly addresses a key differentiator from simpler iPaaS solutions which can also suffer from fragility if not expertly configured and maintained.
436 |     *   **VentureOS Solution & Value:** VentureOS aims to provide professionally built, maintained, and robust integrations as a core component of its operational launchpad.
437 |         *   **"Not Fragile" Defined:** This means integrations are engineered for resilience, with proactive error handling, monitoring for API changes, graceful degradation where possible, and a commitment to maintaining compatibility with supported SaaS tools. The goal is to minimize unexpected breakages and the need for founders to become integration specialists for their core operational stack.
438 |         *   **Beyond Setup Time:** The value extends far beyond initial setup. It's about the cumulative time saved by avoiding troubleshooting sessions, data reconciliation nightmares, and the cognitive load of managing a complex, self-built web of tools.
439 |         *   **Targeting the Pain of Repetition:** Many founders, especially in the "builder" persona, launch multiple ventures or iterate through many projects. The pain of repeatedly setting up and debugging fragmented tool stacks for each new endeavor is significant. VentureOS offers a standardized, reliable, and efficient "better way," reducing this repetitive friction and accelerating each new launch.
440 | 
441 | 2.  **Pillar 2: Holistic Venture Lifecycle Support & Ecosystem Value – Beyond iPaaS Utility.**
442 |     *   **Context & Problem:** While basic automation (the domain of iPaaS like Zapier) solves point problems, founders face a much broader set of challenges across the entire venture creation lifecycle – from ideation and validation through setup, operation, growth, and even potential exit. An "integration platform" alone doesn't address this holistic journey.
443 |     *   **VentureOS Solution & Value:** VentureOS positions itself not merely as an integration tool, but as a comprehensive **operational launchpad and intelligent co-pilot** that supports founders throughout their journey. This intrinsic nature, coupled with the ecosystem, differentiates it significantly from task-oriented iPaaS solutions.
444 |         *   **End-to-End Journey Support:** VentureOS aims to provide value from the earliest stages (e.g., with ideation tools, market validation support as discussed in the Ecosystem supplement) through operational setup (via "Venture Packs" and guided onboarding) and ongoing insights (the "Unified Insight Layer").
445 |         *   **"Investor-Ready" Operations:** A key differentiator is the focus on helping ventures establish operational rigor and transparency that aligns with investor expectations (e.g., clean financials, clear metrics, cap table management guidance). This is a strategic outcome far beyond simple data syncing.
446 |         *   **Ecosystem Amplification:** The value is further amplified by the surrounding ecosystem (content, community, experiential learning tools as per v1.2 supplement), creating a support system that iPaaS tools do not offer. This includes potential long-term value like a Micro-SaaS M&A marketplace.
447 |         *   **Strategic Freemium Model:** To facilitate this broad engagement, a strategic freemium model will offer access to foundational elements of this journey, encouraging adoption and allowing founders to grow with the platform. Monetization will be diversified (premium platform tiers, affiliate partnerships where appropriate, future ecosystem services) rather than solely relying on per-task/per-integration fees common in iPaaS.
448 | 
449 | 3.  **Pillar 3: Co-Creation and Trust through Open Iteration (Focused on Connectors).**
450 |     *   **Context & Problem:** Building a product in a vacuum often leads to misalignment. For integration-heavy platforms, trust in the connectors is paramount.
451 |     *   **VentureOS Solution & Value:** Commit to a transparent development process, building in public where appropriate, and actively incorporating user feedback.
452 |         *   **Open Sourcing Considerations (Connectors Primarily):** As detailed in Section II.B.3, explore open-sourcing *individual SaaS connectors* (or an SDK for building them) once they are mature. This can build trust, allow for community contributions to expand tool coverage, and support transparency.
453 |         *   **Core IP Protection:** This approach explicitly distinguishes that the core, proprietary IP around the sophisticated sync engine, bi-directional binding logic, cross-domain join algorithms, and the Unified Business Object Model (UBOM) would *not* typically be part of this initial open-sourcing strategy, preserving VentureOS's unique technical differentiators.
454 |         *   **Benefits:** This focused openness can foster a sense of community ownership around tool support, ensure connector quality through broader scrutiny, and de-risk the expansion of integrations.
455 | 
456 | ## II. Addressing Technical Feasibility & Reliability of Core Integrations
457 | 
458 | ### A. Initial Challenge & Risk Context: The "Semantic Hell" of Integration & Maintaining Robustness
459 | A core technical challenge, previously identified, is the immense difficulty of building and *maintaining* numerous robust, reliable, and deep API integrations. Each SaaS tool has its own API quirks, data models, rate limits, authentication methods, and versioning strategies. Achieving reliable bi-directional sync and, critically, meaningful cross-domain data "joins" (e.g., linking a Stripe customer to a HubSpot contact and then to PostHog user events) was described as "semantic hell." Data corruption liability is also enormous if write access is implemented carelessly. Previous ideation already touched upon de-risking connector development (e.g., a strategic "build" for core tools vs. "buy" or proxying third-party iPaaS for non-core integrations as a temporary measure). The following points elaborate on ensuring robustness and reliability.
460 | 
461 | ### B. Refined Technical Approach & De-risking Strategies:
462 | 
463 | 1.  **Leveraging LLMs for Connector Development, Tempered with Engineering Rigor:**
464 |     *   **Opportunity:** Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate the initial generation of connector code, data mapping suggestions, and API client scaffolding.
465 |     *   **Realistic Limitation:** Acknowledge that LLMs are a powerful assistant, not a silver bullet. Significant, skilled engineering effort will remain essential for:
466 |         *   Robust error handling and retry logic.
467 |         *   Managing API versioning and deprecation.
468 |         *   Complex authentication flows (e.g., OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens).
469 |         *   Handling pagination and rate limits gracefully.
470 |         *   Developing sophisticated data transformation and validation logic, especially for the "last mile" of ensuring data integrity.
471 | 
472 | 2.  **Pragmatic, Phased Approach to Cross-Domain Joins & Data Sync:**
473 |     *   **Read-Only First for Core Value:** The initial MVP focus for data integration will be on robust and reliable *read-only data aggregation* from official SaaS APIs. This delivers immediate value through unified dashboards and insights while significantly de-risking initial technical development by avoiding the complexities of bi-directional sync.
474 |     *   **Cross-Domain Joins as a Core R&D Priority:** The ability to accurately link entities (e.g., `customer_id` from Stripe to `contact_id` from HubSpot to `distinct_id` from Mixpanel) is fundamental to the "Unified Insight Layer." This will be a central focus of R&D.
475 |         *   **Fallback Scenarios & Transparency:** In cases where perfect, automated joins are initially challenging or not possible (e.g., due to inconsistent data or lack of common identifiers), VentureOS will:
476 |             *   Provide clear feedback to the user about join status and any limitations.
477 |             *   Offer mechanisms for manual linking or rule-based suggestions where feasible.
478 |             *   Ensure that VentureOS still provides value as a central hub for viewing data from individual tools, even if some cross-domain insights are temporarily restricted.
479 |         *   **Continuous Health Checks:** Implement automated systems to continuously monitor the health and integrity of cross-domain ID bindings and data synchronization, providing early warnings of potential issues.
480 |     *   **Selective & Cautious Bi-Directional Sync (Future):** Bi-directional sync will be approached cautiously and selectively, implemented only for high-value, low-risk use cases where APIs are robust, vendor support is strong, and it enables critical "killer workflows." Data integrity and conflict resolution will be paramount.
481 | 
482 | 3.  **Strategic Open Sourcing (Phased and Considered - Primarily for Connectors):**
483 |     *   **Potential Benefits:**
484 |         *   **Increased Trust & Transparency:** Allowing users and the community to inspect connector code can build confidence.
485 |         *   **Community Contributions:** Potential for external developers to contribute new connectors or improvements to existing ones.
486 |         *   **Support for Self-Hosting:** Facilitates offering self-hosted options for data-sensitive organizations.
487 |     *   **Considerations & Risks:**
488 |         *   **Development Overhead:** Maintaining public-facing code quality, documentation, and managing community contributions can slow down internal development cycles.
489 |         *   **Competitive Landscape:** Competitors could potentially leverage open-sourced components.
490 |         *   **Licensing:** Requires careful selection of appropriate open-source licenses.
491 |     *   **Proposed Phased Approach (Reiteration from Pillar I.B.3):**
492 |         *   **Core IP Protection:** The core sync engine, UBOM framework, and advanced cross-domain join logic remain proprietary to protect key differentiators.
493 |         *   **Connector Focus:** Open-source individual, mature connectors or an SDK/framework for building new connectors.
494 | 
495 | 4.  **Self-Hosting Options for Enhanced Data Governance & Trust:**
496 |     *   **Addressing User Concerns:** For ventures with high sensitivity around data privacy and security, offer a self-hosted version of VentureOS.
497 |     *   **Technical Implication:** This adds complexity to deployment, updates, and support models but directly addresses a critical adoption barrier for a specific segment of users.
498 | 
499 | ## III. Addressing "Greenfield" Assumption vs. Retrofitting Existing SaaS Stacks
500 | 
501 | ### A. Initial Challenge & Risk Context: Balancing Ideal Scenarios with Market Reality
502 | Previous discussions highlighted the strategic benefit of focusing on "greenfield" scenarios (new SaaS instance setups) to de-risk integration complexity and ensure optimal data consistency for cross-domain joins. However, the reality is that many potential users will have existing "brownfield" SaaS setups. The challenge is to define a clear stance that leverages the advantages of greenfield while not alienating a significant portion of the market.
503 | 
504 | ### B. Clarified Stance & Multi-Faceted Value Delivery:
505 | 
506 | 1.  **Greenfield as a Strategic Choice for Optimal Value & De-risking:**
507 |     *   VentureOS *chooses* to heavily promote and guide users towards "greenfield" setups (or setups closely aligned with its recommended configurations) as the primary path to unlocking the *fullest value* of the platform, especially the deep, reliable cross-domain insights.
508 |     *   **Rationale:** This approach provides VentureOS with the best control over data consistency, schema alignment (via its internal UBOM), and integration predictability, significantly de-risking the technically challenging aspects of cross-domain joins.
509 |     *   This is a deliberate strategy to ensure a high-quality experience for users seeking the most advanced data unification capabilities.
510 | 
511 | 2.  **Best-Effort Support for Existing ("Brownfield") Setups with Defensive Design:**
512 |     *   VentureOS will *not be architecturally prevented* from attempting to connect to and work with existing SaaS instances.
513 |     *   **"Trying" with Transparency:** Support will be on a best-effort basis, with clear communication to users that the level of integration and the availability of sophisticated cross-domain insights may be limited by the state of their existing setup (e.g., heavy customization, inconsistent data, lack of clear identifiers).
514 |     *   **Defensive Feature Design:** VentureOS features, particularly dashboards and reports, will be designed defensively. This means:
515 |         *   They will aim to deliver value even if only data from individual silos is available (no cross-domain joins).
516 |         *   They will gracefully handle missing or incomplete data from certain sources.
517 |         *   The UI will clearly indicate the status of integrations and data joins.
518 | 
519 | 3.  **Value Delivery Beyond Perfect Integration:**
520 |     *   Critically, VentureOS's value proposition extends beyond flawless data integration. Even in scenarios where cross-domain joins are imperfect or some integrations are not possible with a user's existing complex stack, VentureOS aims to deliver significant value through:
521 |         *   **Guided Setup & Best Practices:** For any *new* tools a founder adopts, even alongside existing ones.
522 |         *   **Ideation & Validation Tools:** (e.g., "LLM Pitch Tester," "Idea Machine").
523 |         *   **Strategic Content Marketing & Thought Leadership:** Providing actionable advice and insights.
524 |         *   **Community & Networking:** Connecting founders with peers, mentors, and resources.
525 |         *   **Centralized Hub for Available Data:** Even if not perfectly joined, having data from multiple tools accessible via a single pane of glass can still be more efficient than logging into numerous separate systems.
526 |     *   This multi-faceted value proposition ensures that VentureOS remains relevant and useful even when facing the inherent complexities of diverse brownfield environments.
527 | 
528 | ## IV. Addressing Scope Creep & Resource Allocation (Core Product vs. Ecosystem)
529 | 
530 | ### A. Initial Challenge & Risk Context: The Allure of Expansion vs. Focused Execution
531 | The full VentureOS vision, encompassing a core operational SaaS product *and* an extensive content, community, and experiential ecosystem, is ambitious. A significant risk is spreading resources too thinly by attempting to build too many ecosystem components concurrently with the core product, thereby delaying product-market fit for the foundational offering. There's also the temptation to compensate for unsolved hard technical problems (like perfect data sync) by adding more peripheral features, which can dilute focus.
532 | 
533 | ### B. Refined Prioritization, Phasing, and Strategic Synergy:
534 | 
535 | 1.  **Unyielding Focus on Core Product MVP First:** The absolute top priority is to develop, validate, and achieve product-market fit for the core VentureOS operational launchpad and unified insight layer. This is the defensible heart of the venture.
536 | 2.  **Strategic Role of Ideation & Ecosystem Tools – As Accelerants, Not Distractions:**
537 |     *   **Acknowledgement:** Certain ideation-phase tools (e.g., "LLM Investor Pitch & Thesis Stress-Tester," "Idea Machine") and foundational ecosystem elements (focused content, initial community) can be developed relatively quickly and offer significant value.
538 |     *   **Purpose:** These are not intended to *replace* the core product's value but to *augment* it and *accelerate its adoption* by:
539 |         *   **Acting as High-Value Lead Magnets:** Attracting the target ICP into the VentureOS ecosystem.
540 |         *   **Providing Tangible Early Wins:** Delivering immediate utility to founders even before they fully adopt the core operational platform.
541 |         *   **Facilitating a Smooth Transition to Core Product:** Creating clear pathways from engagement with ideation tools or content to experiencing the core operational benefits (e.g., via the Functional Sandbox).
542 |             *   *Crucial Example Flow:* A founder uses the "LLM Investor Pitch & Thesis Stress-Tester" to refine their pitch. The tool then suggests, "Now that your pitch is sharp, let VentureOS help you set up and track the core operations to execute on that vision. Try our Functional Sandbox with a pre-configured 'Lean SaaS MVP' pack tailored to your venture type."
543 |     *   **Resource Allocation Discipline:** Allocate resources to these ecosystem elements strategically, ensuring they do not starve the development of the core product. They should be lean, high-impact initiatives.
544 | 
545 | 3.  **Phased Rollout of the Broader Ecosystem:** More resource-intensive ecosystem components (e.g., comprehensive courses, a full-scale VentureSim, a sophisticated marketplace) will be developed and layered in incrementally, post-MVP validation of the core product, and driven by demonstrated user needs and resource availability.
546 | 
547 | ## V. Evolved MVP Definition, Launch Strategy, and Key Feature Development
548 | 
549 | ### A. Addressing the Core Tension: Focused Value vs. Broad Appeal
550 | A key strategic tension was identified: balancing the deep, defensible value of a "Focused Operational Launchpad for VC-Track Startups" against the wider funnel and potentially weaker moat of a "Broad Freemium Builder Infra + Ideation Tools." The refined MVP strategy seeks to strategically integrate these, using the latter to fuel the former.
551 | 
552 | ### B. Phased MVP Launch & User Journey – From Demo to Full Integration:
553 | 
554 | This strategy allows for early market engagement and learning while progressively de-risking the core technical build.
555 | 
556 | 1.  **Phase 1: Initial Market Engagement, Lead Generation & Vision Showcase (Launch ASAP)**
557 |     *   **Live Digital Products (Early Wins & Lead Magnets):**
558 |         *   **"LLM Investor Pitch & Thesis Stress-Tester":** A standalone, high-value tool targeting the VC-track ICP, helping them refine pitches and stress-test their venture thesis using LLM-simulated investor personas.
559 |         *   **"Idea Machine":** An interactive LLM-powered tool for brainstorming and curating venture concepts, appealing to a broader range of builders.
560 |     *   **Strategic Content Marketing & Thought Leadership:** Development and dissemination of high-value content (articles, playbooks, analyses based on market research and emerging patterns) to establish authority, drive organic traffic (SEO), and provide actionable insights. This replaces the more specific "VentureFormula™" branding with a broader functional description.
561 |     *   **Vision Showcase (Core Product Teaser):**
562 |         *   **High-Fidelity Interactive Demo (Frontend Only):** A polished, clickable prototype (e.g., Figma or a frontend build with dummy data) that clearly illustrates the UI, UX, and envisioned value of the "VentureOS Command Center" / "Investor Ready Dashboard."
563 |             *   **Transparency:** Clearly labeled as "Interactive Demo - See the Future of VentureOS."
564 |             *   **Purpose:** To communicate the grand vision, gather early feedback on desired insights and dashboard usability, and build anticipation.
565 |             *   **Call to Action (CTA):** "Intrigued by the vision? See how it starts to come alive! Request access to our upcoming Functional Sandbox." or "Join our waitlist for early access to the Functional Sandbox."
566 |     *   **Primary Internal Engineering Focus During This Phase:** Intensive development of the "Functional Sandbox with Real Trial SaaS Accounts."
567 | 
568 | 2.  **Phase 2: Launch of "Functional Sandbox with Real Trial SaaS Accounts" (Critical Validation Milestone)**
569 |     *   **Core Offering & Purpose:** This is the first tangible demonstration of VentureOS's core integration capabilities. Its primary purpose is to validate the technical feasibility and perceived value of the unified insight layer.
570 |     *   **Mechanism:**
571 |         1.  **User Onboards to Sandbox:** Signs up specifically for the VentureOS Sandbox experience.
572 |         2.  **Guided SaaS Trial Account Setup/Connection:** VentureOS guides the user to create *new, actual free trial accounts* with a curated set of 2-3 core SaaS tools (e.g., Stripe for payments, HubSpot for CRM [free tier], PostHog for product analytics [free tier]). Alternatively, if a user has *clean, empty* trial accounts for these specific tools, they might be able to connect those.
573 |         3.  **VentureOS Connects (Read-Only via Real Backend):** VentureOS uses its *actual, developed backend integration code* (APIs, OAuth) to connect to these newly created/designated trial SaaS instances.
574 |         4.  **VentureOS Populates with Standardized Demo Data (Recommended):** To make the dashboard immediately meaningful, VentureOS (via API, if the SaaS tool allows) pushes a small, standardized set of realistic but fictional demo data into these trial accounts (e.g., a few customers, deals, sample MRR, user events).
575 |         5.  **The VentureOS Dashboard Experience:** The user then interacts with the VentureOS dashboard, which is pulling, processing, and displaying insights derived from *this data, from their own newly created/connected trial SaaS instances*.
576 |     *   **Key Distinction from a Mock Demo:** The dashboard isn't just showing static mockups. It's displaying data that VentureOS has *actually processed from real SaaS accounts connected via its backend*. This proves the *mechanism* of integration.
577 |     *   **User Journey:** Users might be funneled from the interactive demo, or directly from marketing campaigns for the Sandbox. The demo can serve as a "low-commitment preview" before a user decides to engage with the slightly more involved sandbox setup.
578 |     *   **Call to Action (CTA) from Sandbox:** "Experienced the power of integrated insights? Ready to connect your *own* live business accounts? Request early access to the full VentureOS platform."
579 | 
580 | 3.  **Phase 3: Private Beta with User's Own Live (or Dev/Staging) Accounts**
581 |     *   Carefully onboard a select group of users (ideally from the most engaged sandbox users) to connect their actual, live business SaaS accounts (or their development/staging instances first, for further de-risking).
582 |     *   Focus on intensive feedback, bug fixing, and performance optimization.
583 | 
584 | 4.  **Phase 4: Public Launch of Core Operational Platform**
585 |     *   Wider public availability of VentureOS, allowing users to connect their production SaaS accounts. Iterative rollout of "Venture Packs" and advanced features.
586 | 
587 | ### C. Augmentative Feature Concepts & Considerations (For Future Exploration & Enhancement):
588 | 
589 | The following are not intended to override core MVP features but represent additional ideas that could augment the platform's value or provide specific "wow" factors once the foundational elements are in place. They should be considered for future development phases or as specific enhancements to existing plans, not as primary drivers of the initial MVP.
590 | 
591 | 1.  **"Investor-Ready" Value Proposition Enhancement (Especially for VC-Track ICP):**
592 |     *   **Automated Investor Update Snapshots:** A feature to easily generate concise, data-driven updates for investors, pulling key metrics (MRR, burn rate, cash runway, user growth, pipeline velocity) directly from the integrated VentureOS Command Center.
593 |     *   **Understanding Reporting Cadence:** Design for common reporting needs: typically monthly KPI updates for seed-stage investors, with more comprehensive data available for quarterly board meetings or ad-hoc requests. The primary pain point is the manual compilation and reconciliation of this data.
594 |     *   **Framing:** Position VentureOS as a tool that empowers founders to be prepared, transparent, and efficient in their investor communications, saving them significant time and reducing stress.
595 | 
596 | 2.  **"Operational Due Diligence Score" & "VentureOS Verified Operations" Badge (Potential Future Trust Signals):**
597 |     *   **Concept:** Introduce mechanisms that help founders demonstrate and improve their operational maturity, and signal this to external parties (investors, acquirers).
598 |     *   **"Operational Due Diligence Score" (Internal Tool):**
599 |         *   An internal metric or dashboard for the founder, providing an assessment of their venture's operational health and completeness based on factors like successful integration of core tools, data hygiene, and tracking of critical KPIs.
600 |         *   **Purpose:** Acts as an internal compass, highlighting areas for operational improvement. Could also be a valuable, objective measure in Micro-SaaS M&A due diligence if shared by the founder.
601 |         *   **Development:** Requires collaboration with SMEs (startup CFOs, accountants, VCs) to define meaningful and objective criteria.
602 |     *   **"VentureOS Verified Operations" Badge (Optional, Public-Facing Signal):**
603 |         *   A digital badge that a founder can choose to display once their setup meets predefined criteria for operational completeness as facilitated by VentureOS.
604 |         *   **Value:** A credible signal of operational maturity to investors, partners, and potential acquirers; a viral growth loop for VentureOS.
605 |         *   **Framing:** Crucially, position this as an *empowerment* tool for founders ("Showcase your operational excellence") rather than an external judgment. "Pass vs. Not Verified" is likely more appropriate for a public badge.
606 | 
607 | 3.  **Gamification & Virality for the Functional Sandbox (Enhancement for Engagement):**
608 |     *   **Concept:** Introduce interactive elements within the "Functional Sandbox" to enhance engagement, learning, and shareability.
609 |     *   **"Sandbox Challenges":** Create time-bound, objective-driven challenges using the simulated environment (e.g., "Grow your simulated MRR by X%").
610 |     *   **Leaderboards & Social Sharing:** Allow users to (optionally) share their progress or compete.
611 |     *   **Strategic Value:** Excellent for viral marketing and partnerships.
612 | 
613 | 4.  **Curated Integration for Specialized Needs (Example: LLM API Cost Monitoring):**
614 |     *   Strategically integrate with best-of-breed existing solutions for specific pain points, pulling summary data into the VentureOS Command Center. This avoids reinventing the wheel and can provide affiliate revenue opportunities.
615 | 
616 | ## VI. Guiding Philosophy: Empowerment and Pragmatic Innovation
617 | 
618 | Throughout this refined strategy, the guiding philosophy for VentureOS remains centered on **empowering venture builders** by simplifying operational complexity, providing actionable insights, and fostering a supportive ecosystem. The approach to innovation will be pragmatic, prioritizing features that deliver tangible value and de-risking complex technical challenges through phased implementation and continuous user feedback. The journey begins with focused execution on a compelling MVP that clearly demonstrates the core promise, paving the way for the realization of the broader VentureOS vision.

 34 | ## We make secure data access easy
 35 |

 37 | 
 38 | ##### Add hundreds of integrations within weeks
 39 | 
 40 | Merge enables B2B software companies to add hundreds of integrations to their products, making it easy for them to access and sync their customers’ data.
 41 | 
 42 | ‍
 43 | 
 44 | ‍
 45 | 
 46 | ##### Your all-in-one integration solution
 47 | 
 48 | Merge offers Unified APIs that provide normalized data across key software categories, including accounting, HRIS, ATS, CRM, file storage, and ticketing. Merge also handles the full integrations lifecycle — from an easy initial build taking just weeks, to providing integration observability tools ensuring customer delight, and fully owning the maintenance of integrations.
 49 | 
 50 | ‍
 51 | 
 52 | ‍
 53 | 
 54 | ##### Turn integrations into your competitive advantage
 55 | 
 56 | Thousands of companies trust Merge to power integrations that unblock sales, reduce customer churn, accelerate time to market for new products, and save engineering costs and resources.

 60 | ## We serve as the data integration layer
 61 | 
 62 | ‍
 63 | 
 64 | ##### Integrations are table stakes in the B2B SaaS world
 65 | 
 66 | Every B2B software company faces the same challenge: their customers use dozens of different tools that need to work together, and they expect every software provider to offer integrations with their existing vendors.
 67 | 
 68 | ‍
 69 | 
 70 | ‍
 71 | 
 72 | ##### But integrations don’t have to be a headache
 73 | 
 74 | Building and maintaining integrations with each vendor has traditionally been complex, expensive, and time-consuming. We're changing that. Merge lets you integrate with customers’ third party vendors faster and more reliably than ever.

 82 | ## How Merge got started
 83 | 
 84 | Merge began in 2020 when founders Shensi Ding and Gil Feig turned their shared frustration into innovation. After experiencing the headaches of building and maintaining software integrations at different B2B companies in 2020, Shensi Ding and Gil Feig set out to solve one of software's most persistent challenges—making secure data access easy.

 41 | 
 42 | In the age of AI, data reigns supreme. AI companies strive to extract meaningful insights and make accurate predictions, all in the pursuit of enhancing decision-making processes. Whether founding a new company, bringing a new AI-enhanced product to market, or improving an existing product with AI, a wide range of companies can benefit from [broadening the data set](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2021/06/27/the-data-paradox-artificial-intelligence-needs-data-data-needs-ai/) their products have access to.
 43 | 
 44 | To achieve this, they require vast amounts of data from various sources—a place where B2B software integrations play a pivotal role. By integrating with their customers' systems of record, AI companies can gather diverse datasets, fueling their AI products and enabling them to operate at their full potential.
 45 | 
 46 | _Related:_ [_How integrations can help you build an AI-powered SaaS product_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/saas-ai)
 47 | 
 48 | ### Integrations fuel B2B AI products
 49 | 
 50 | Software integrations serve as a backbone of data acquisition for B2B AI companies. These integrations allow companies to tap into an array of their customers' data sources, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, accounting systems, HR records, e-commerce platforms, social media networks, and more. Software integrations can automate the data collection process, ensuring a constant flow of up-to-date information that powers AI algorithms, making them more accurate and reliable.
 51 | 
 52 | Here are several examples:
 53 | 
 54 | - An AI-powered customer service solution can [integrate with CRM systems](https://merge.dev/blog/crm-api-integration) to access customer profiles, purchase history, and support ticket data. This integration provides a holistic view of customers, enabling the AI tool to deliver personalized and efficient customer support.
 55 | - An AI-powered marketing platform can integrate with email marketing tools, social media management systems, and analytics platforms. By doing so, the AI tool can access real-time campaign data, target audience segments, and performance metrics, thus optimizing marketing strategies with AI-driven insights.
 56 | 
 57 | ### How AI companies use product integrations
 58 | 
 59 | [Gong](https://www.gong.io/) is a revenue intelligence platform that uses AI to derive useful insights about sales conversations and customer interactions. Gong offers an extensive [array of integrations](https://integrations.gong.io/) that bring in more context, such as support calls and chats, to their AI-powered customer insights.
 60 | 
 61 | [Ramp](https://ramp.com/) is a spend management platform that recently released a [suite of AI-powered features called Ramp Intelligence](https://ramp.com/intelligence). Ramp integrates with [more than 1,000 services](https://ramp.com/integrations)—including banks, accounting systems, and HR systems—that help automate user workflows and provide a data foundation for many of their AI-based features.
 62 | 
 63 | ‍ [Apollo](https://www.apollo.io/) is a sales intelligence and engagement platform that automates prospect engagement workflows with AI. These [AI-powered sales plays and emails](https://www.apollo.io/apollo-ai) work with contact data from [integrations with leading CRM and marketing automation tools](https://www.apollo.io/product).
 64 | 
 65 | [Peoplelogic](https://peoplelogic.ai/) is an employee engagement platform that uses AI to recommend actions to improve employee experience. AI-based insights are generated from data collected by [integrations to CRM, support, collaboration, and HR systems](https://peoplelogic.ai/integrations).
 66 | 
 67 | [Kraftful](https://www.kraftful.com/) is an AI tool for user feedback, or as they put it "ChatGPT but for Product Research." Since launching on ProductHunt in February they have been wildly successful with this new approach to sifting through and gathering insights from customers. To power these insights, they offer support and helpdesk integrations—such as Zendesk and Intercom—to capture data from users. Their AI then synthesizes user feedback and sentiment from these support tickets and call transcripts using ChatGPT.
 68 | 
 69 | [Erudit](https://www.erudit.ai/) is an AI-powered product for workforce insights, including employee productivity, happiness, and engagement. This helps employers predict and prevent turnover in their teams. In order to generate these insights, Erudit has [product integrations that connect to collaboration tools](https://www.erudit.ai/integrations) such as Google, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. Analyzing this data set with AI allows Erudit to offer survey-free employee sentiment analysis.
 70 | 
 71 | ‍ [FutureFit AI](https://www.futurefit.ai/) is an AI-powered tool for workforce development. FutureFit AI pulls data from a variety of labor data sources, including job boards, to create a personalized roadmap of learning, resources, and work opportunities for their career.

 74 | 
 75 | ### Common integration use cases for AI companies
 76 | 
 77 | Your customers use a wide variety of tools to store their corporate data. The following systems of record are a common starting point for B2B AI integrations:
 78 | 
 79 | **Recruiting and HR data:** Candidates, new hires, and employee records form the basis of a new set of talent tools. Examples: [Hireguide](https://www.hireguide.com/), [Leena AI](https://leena.ai/), [Sinecure](https://sinecure.ai/), [Tangelo](https://www.tangelo.ai/)
 80 | 
 81 | **Accounting data:** Revenue, expense, tax, and balance sheet info can be quickly turned into financial insights by AI-enabled FP&A products. Examples: [Affinda](https://www.affinda.com/), [Boast.ai](https://boast.ai/), [Digitoo](https://www.digitoo.ai/)
 82 | 
 83 | **CRM and Marketing data:** Account, opportunity, contact, and campaign data provides a rich set of information for sales and marketing AIs. Example: [Persado](https://www.persado.com/)
 84 | 
 85 | **Customer Support data:** Chats, emails, and calls are a logical starting point for AI-based synthesis and analysis. Examples: [Ada](https://www.ada.cx/), [inFeedo](https://www.infeedo.ai/), [Macorva Customer Experience](https://www.macorva.com/)
 86 | 
 87 | **Task Tracking and Collaboration data:** Corporate chat, email, and project planners can provide a basis for AI-assisted analysis of employee productivity and sentiment as well as useful tasks such as note taking. Examples: [Anecdotes](https://www.anecdotes.ai/), [Railtown AI](https://www.railtown.ai/)
 88 | 
 89 | **Document data:** Documents stored in online file drives can power AI features such as identifying plaintext sensitive keys to proactively alert information security teams. Examples: [Google Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai), [Ocrolus](https://www.ocrolus.com/)
 90 | 
 91 | ### Adding B2B integrations to power your AI products
 92 | 
 93 | B2B software integrations serve as a fundamental enabler for AI companies, facilitating data gathering and augmenting the capabilities of their AI tools. However, building and maintaining integrations is time consuming, even for talented engineering teams. Normalizing data from multiple data sources into a coherent format for AI tools to process is a further challenge.
 94 | 
 95 | Merge offers Unified APIs that make it simple to add hundreds of integrations—accounting, CRM, HR, file storage, marketing, recruiting, ticketing, and more—to your product. With these integrations your customers can link their accounts to your software and Merge will continuously sync data for your AI-powered product to work its magic. [Sign up for free](https://app.merge.dev/login) or [chat with our team](https://merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fpowering-ai-with-product-integrations) to better understand how a Unified API can speed your time to market and give you the data you need to grow your business.
 96 | 
 97 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 49 | 
 50 | Offering product integrations in every pricing plan lets you reap the full benefits of providing them—from unblocking sales deals to improving customer retention to expanding to new markets.
 51 | 
 52 | We’ll break down why by sharing several real-world examples.
 53 | 
 54 | ## **Differentiates your product in a crowded market**
 55 | 
 56 | As prospects evaluate your solution against others, they’ll likely hear and read about nearly identical product claims, whether that’s related to core functionality, security, uptime, and more.
 57 | 
 58 | Providing product integrations across your pricing plans offers the opportunity to break through the noise and provide clear differentiation.
 59 | 
 60 | Take [Ramp](https://ramp.com/), a financial operations platform, as an example.
 61 | 
 62 | Their products compete in several fast-growing markets—from corporate cards to expense management to travel.
 63 | 
 64 | To help their platform stand out across these markets, they offer their [HRIS integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/guide-to-hris-api-integrations) as part of every plan (with the exception of Workday).
 65 | 
 66 | [![How Ramp prices their HRIS integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681264e24cd06314f0c980ec_Screenshot%202025-04-30%20at%201.58.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681264e24cd06314f0c980ec_Screenshot%202025-04-30%20at%201.58.18%E2%80%AFPM.png)
 67 | 
 68 | _How Ramp includes HRIS integrations on their pricing page_
 69 | 
 70 | Paul Durocher, a former senior sales manager at Ramp, validates the strategy’s efficacy:
 71 | 
 72 | ##### “One of the first questions a prospect asks is if we can integrate with their HRIS application. Being able to say we can across all our plans has consistently helped us close more deals.”
 73 | 
 74 | ## **Accelerates your product’s time to value**
 75 | 
 76 | Product integrations help automate error-prone, time-intensive tasks in your product, which leads to happier customers and, in most cases, a higher retention rate.
 77 | 
 78 | [allwhere](https://www.allwhere.co/)—an IT asset management platform for distributed teams—offers up a great example.
 79 | 
 80 | Their HRIS integrations enable customers to identify incoming new hires and departing employees and kickstart the appropriate procurement and retrieval workflows automatically. Without these integrations, allwhere’s customers would have to find out when employees are joining and leaving themselves before kickstarting the right workflow in allwhere manually.
 81 | 
 82 | Given how valuable HRIS integrations are to allwhere’s user experience, the team decided to offer them at no additional charge.
 83 | 
 84 | Jimmy Jameson, allwhere’s former product strategy and operations lead, adds more context on the decision:
 85 | 
 86 | ##### "Our integrations are a great way to get clients onboarded into our product quickly and experience a fast time to value, so we think our integrations will ultimately pay for themselves through improved customer retention."
 87 | 
 88 | ## **Enables your business to expand into new markets**
 89 | 
 90 | Companies of a specific size, region, and/or industry often use a particular application within a given software category. For example, Tally is a popular accounting solution for SMBs, while QuickBooks is widely used by enterprise companies.
 91 | 
 92 | If you can offer integrations with the application(s) your target market uses at no additional cost, you can more easily sell into companies in that market.
 93 | 
 94 | For instance, [ExpenseOnDemand](https://www.expenseondemand.com/), an expense management software, wanted to expand their presence in Europe, which required offering [integrations with the accounting applications](https://www.merge.dev/blog/accounting-integration) that are popular in the region, such as Xero.
 95 | 
 96 | With that in mind, they not only added these integrations but also provided them across their plans.
 97 | 
 98 | [![ExpenseOnDemand's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681260e760e59d1a0caf1691_AD_4nXfv5ilcXKYqeyLWLYJ7bIdfUkCxjTjP89UxWxDf7d8fTOmqpXbz2pDmv9rD2P7zTr10x-G0HOdHt8xHTQIgWJn39iOhtwoOUPJHUAxcYoi2cKM4GfGUboARQFyG5fS2-eesrjNZXQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681260e760e59d1a0caf1691_AD_4nXfv5ilcXKYqeyLWLYJ7bIdfUkCxjTjP89UxWxDf7d8fTOmqpXbz2pDmv9rD2P7zTr10x-G0HOdHt8xHTQIgWJn39iOhtwoOUPJHUAxcYoi2cKM4GfGUboARQFyG5fS2-eesrjNZXQ.png)

101 | 
102 | ## **Offer all the integrations you need through Merge**
103 | 
104 | Merge, the leading unified API solution, lets you add hundreds of cross-category integrations to your product through a Unified API.
105 | 
106 | [![Merge's integration marketplace](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681260e702f9ba7a2a1250f4_AD_4nXc731Fq-KFW4p_Im03m0dM7q4QKl2MePWOpTzqzlarYLNqM7A7JmiTPAvLSiUK1TF4uEBBthbEkjz1A3_h7blDgPVyXds_3S8OmeffQeE_fyOdTi9yIvMNw0gJBvVHreeVyq6cSSQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681260e702f9ba7a2a1250f4_AD_4nXc731Fq-KFW4p_Im03m0dM7q4QKl2MePWOpTzqzlarYLNqM7A7JmiTPAvLSiUK1TF4uEBBthbEkjz1A3_h7blDgPVyXds_3S8OmeffQeE_fyOdTi9yIvMNw0gJBvVHreeVyq6cSSQ.png)
107 | 
108 | _Merge supports CRM, accounting, ticketing, file storage, HRIS and ATS integrations_
109 | 
110 | Merge also provides strategic support to help your team decide on the best strategy to price your integrations, market them, support them, and more.
111 | 
112 | You can learn all about Merge’s integrations, go-to-market support, observability features, and more by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fpricing-software-integrations).
113 | 
114 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 47 | 
 48 | Prismatic is an embedded iPaaS solution that lets you build integrations and workflow automations between your product and your customers’ applications.
 49 | 
 50 | The platform offers [pre-built API connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector) across software categories to help you build integrations quickly; an integration marketplace that enables customers to discover and activate integrations themselves; integration observability features to provide visibility and context on specific integration issues–and more.
 51 | 
 52 | To help you assess the platform and determine if it’s right for your business, we’ll break down Prismatic’s pricing plans.
 53 | 
 54 | ## **Overview on Prismatic’s pricing strategy**
 55 | 
 56 | Prismatic offers 3 pricing plans: Scale, Enterprise, and Custom.
 57 | 
 58 | [![Screenshot of Prismatic's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3a9da4e19d489d9f3a7c_Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%201.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3a9da4e19d489d9f3a7c_Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%201.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)
 59 | 
 60 | Each plan requires you to connect with their team and there’s no cost figures outlined.
 61 | 
 62 | That said, the Scale plan includes all of the foundational components to get started. And as you move up these plans, the main changes are the security and performance capabilities you’d unlock.
 63 | 
 64 | More security conscious customers may request to host the integrated data on-prem to have complete control over it (on the Enterprise plan); customers that anticipate supporting a high volume of integrations may need high concurrency limits to prevent sync delays (on the Enterprise plan); customers that are focused on mitigating the impact of any issues will want an SLA (on the Custom plan)—and the list goes on.
 65 | 
 66 | It’s also worth noting that the Scale plan doesn’t allow your customers to build any integrations—your team has to implement and manage all of them on the customer’s behalf.
 67 | 
 68 | #### Don't settle for Prismatic

 75 | 
 76 | ## **Pros and cons of Prismatic’s pricing strategy**
 77 | 
 78 | Here are some of the benefits and drawbacks of their pricing model:
 79 | 
 80 | ### **Pros**
 81 | 
 82 | - **The Scale plan is fairly comprehensive.** It lets you build unlimited integrations and provide [embedded integration marketplaces](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace) across your customer base—which are the core features of their platform.
 83 | 
 84 | - **Enterprise-grade security features are covered in most plans.** You can use either the Enterprise or Custom plan to access the security features you need to move upmarket with your integrations
 85 | 
 86 | - **Every plan offers a high level of support.** The Scale plan lets you access email and chat support, includes a dedicated account manager, and provides a standard SLA. And as you move up to an Enterprise or Custom plan, the level of support would only get better. For example, the Enterprise plan offers “White-glove” support via email and chat (which likely translates to faster response times, more resources assigned to support you, etc.)
 87 | 
 88 | ### **Cons**
 89 | 
 90 | - **There’s no transparency on pricing.** You can’t find out how much a plan costs without speaking to a sales rep. This can lead you to take a meeting only to learn that their pricing is out of your budget or doesn’t meet your [integration needs](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-requirements)
 91 | 
 92 | - **They don’t offer HIPAA compliance on their Launch plan.** Failing to meet this foundational compliance measure can prevent you from getting many, if not most, of your customers to adopt your integrations
 93 | 
 94 | [![A screenshot of the security features and compliance requirements Prismatic meets across plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e38bace3940049e102d85_AD_4nXf8tCDr2PaizqtG5lbPYb4PrW1FMpe12j2ApbaIBpsss38UvO_K-LysSSyOKho9V4dr4bsCUrSPenM1V2ai6cq73A0l1o9BBnDjDqoBJv10u5O-a_RLEjKfNEGetczZPlGGXcg-CA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e38bace3940049e102d85_AD_4nXf8tCDr2PaizqtG5lbPYb4PrW1FMpe12j2ApbaIBpsss38UvO_K-LysSSyOKho9V4dr4bsCUrSPenM1V2ai6cq73A0l1o9BBnDjDqoBJv10u5O-a_RLEjKfNEGetczZPlGGXcg-CA.png)
 95 | 
 96 | _Prismatic also doesn’t offer CJIS compliance on their Scale plan_
 97 | 
 98 | - **There’s no trial or proof of concept option.** You can’t test drive their integrations or any of their other features before signing up for one of their plans. This makes your investment in the platform relatively risky and uncomfortable
 99 | 
100 | Note: There may be some proof of concept option available once you connect with their team. It just isn’t mentioned on their site.

107 | 
108 | ## **How Merge addresses these drawbacks**
109 | 
110 | Merge, the leading unified API solution, not only offers HIPAA compliance across its plans but also complies with other critical security frameworks, such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 Type 2.
111 | 
112 | Merge also provides more transparency on its pricing and offers _every_ prospect the opportunity to participate in a proof of concept to validate their integration use cases.

116 | _A snapshot of Merge’s Launch plan_
117 | 
118 | Last but not least, Merge offers a fundamentally different approach to helping you build integrations.
119 | 
120 | Instead of forcing you to build each integration in Prismatic’s “low-code integration designer”, you can simply build to Merge’s Unified API to unlock hundreds of cross-category integrations for your product.
121 | 
122 | [![A screenshot that shows that Merge lets you add accounting, ATS, HRIS, CRM, file storage, and ticketing integrations through a single, unified API](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3e7f5ee69509d1505445_Homepage%20hero%20illustration%20(5).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3e7f5ee69509d1505445_Homepage%20hero%20illustration%20(5).png)

 51 | 
 52 | A clear, practical process for managing the product development lifecycle is critical to ensuring new products work smoothly with your customers' existing tech stack and workflows.
 53 | 
 54 | Implementing this process is easier said than done. Product managers have to include plans for unforeseen technical complexity, develop tight cross-functional collaboration processes, balance speed with quality carefully, and more.
 55 | 
 56 | To help you implement an effective product development lifecycle (PDLC) process successfully, we’ll align on its definition, review the key stages to consider, share best practices for building any, and more.
 57 | 
 58 | ## **What is the product development lifecycle?**
 59 | 
 60 | It’s a structured process for taking a product to market. It includes ideation, planning, design, development, testing, launch, and analysis and maintenance post-launch.
 61 | 
 62 | [![A look at the key stages of the product development lifecycle](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b9d714e706c7df6ebf813_Group%2012%20(6).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b9d714e706c7df6ebf813_Group%2012%20(6).png)
 63 | 
 64 | It’s worth clarifying the differences between the PDLC and the broader product lifecycle (PLC). The PDLC focuses on creating and launching a product successfully, while the PLC spans the full arc of a product’s existence—including its later stages of maturity, up until it's deprecated.
 65 | 
 66 | _Related:_ [_What is a product experience strategy? Here’s what you need to know_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-experience-strategy)
 67 | 
 68 | ## ‍ **Key stages of the product development lifecycle**
 69 | 
 70 | Most teams follow a familiar set of phases, whether they’re using Agile, Waterfall, or hybrid methodologies. And while exact workflows may vary, the underlying structure remains consistent.
 71 | 
 72 | ### **Idea generation and discovery**
 73 | 
 74 | Ideas emerge from customer feedback, competitive analysis, internal discussions, and observed market gaps.
 75 | 
 76 | At this stage, teams should focus on _problem clarity_—what pain points are we solving? For whom? Why now?
 77 | 
 78 | It’s also the right time to start identifying _external dependencies_.
 79 | 
 80 | For example, say you learn that your customers will need your product to integrate with their HR software to automate user provisioning. The external dependencies for this product requirement would be the API providers and their endpoints for fetching employee data.
 81 | 
 82 | ### **Product planning and validation**
 83 | 
 84 | With a promising idea in hand, your team can move on to [product planning](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-planning). This includes defining scope, aligning around product vision, exploring feasibility, and building the business case.
 85 | 
 86 | Frameworks like RICE (reach, impact, confidence, and effort) or MoSCoW (must have, should have, could have, won’t have) can help your team prioritize features effectively.
 87 | 
 88 | [![An example of using the MoSCoW framework](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b9a0e4c2b52f99b247324_AD_4nXcI7LQYiO491kbZCbu1WP_q7we8kEOoCShz315xTiyQylrx7WQ7D921mhf979m9GhqhM3EBSlN2KlDUEFyguMYPD3ocMZhDywMXAsJyLh0vphyOam7yCWcAvCC527lfYtG-3f-0xQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b9a0e4c2b52f99b247324_AD_4nXcI7LQYiO491kbZCbu1WP_q7we8kEOoCShz315xTiyQylrx7WQ7D921mhf979m9GhqhM3EBSlN2KlDUEFyguMYPD3ocMZhDywMXAsJyLh0vphyOam7yCWcAvCC527lfYtG-3f-0xQ.png)
 89 | 
 90 | _How you can use the MoSCoW framework to prioritize your product development plans_
 91 | 
 92 | Importantly, this stage should surface the full complexity of what needs to be built, including any integration or compliance requirements that could affect timelines or architecture. This helps minimize surprises later and allows teams to sequence work more effectively.
 93 | 
 94 | You should also research and brainstorm potential issues that can go wrong at each step and identify and document the most appropriate contingency plans. Hopefully, this won’t be used, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.
 95 | 
 96 | _Related:_ [_How to design an AI product strategy_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy)
 97 | 
 98 | ### **Design and prototyping**
 99 | 
100 | With validated priorities, the focus shifts to mocking up product UIs, workflows and gathering feedback.
101 | 
102 | Successful teams treat this as a collaborative loop between product, design, and engineering. The goal isn’t to create static visuals—it’s to test assumptions early and refine how users will interact with the product.
103 | 
104 | When ecosystem readiness is part of the product’s value (e.g., the need to exchange data with another tool), it’s critical to prototype those workflows too, not tack them on later.
105 | 
106 | ### **Development**
107 | 
108 | At this phase, product requirements need to turn into working software.
109 | 
110 | Common friction points here include scope creep, vague requirements, and poor handoff from design.
111 | 
112 | Any external dependencies, such as 3rd-party API endpoints getting deprecated or changed in a way that’s backwards incompatible, can also slow things down. Hopefully, the contingency plans defined in the product planning and validation step can be leveraged here to minimize any slowdown in velocity.
113 | 
114 | ### **Testing and iteration**
115 | 
116 | Before launch, your product will need to go through rounds of QA, user acceptance testing (UAT), and stakeholder reviews.
117 | 
118 | The goal is twofold: ensure the product works as intended and ensure it fits the user’s workflow.
119 | 
120 | Issues caught here are much cheaper to fix than post-release bugs, so now would be the time to seek as much feedback as possible. To that end, you can even try to recruit a design partner that’s eager to adopt your solution. They’ll be aggressive in providing feedback, as they likely have a compelling vision for how they want to use your solution.
121 | 
122 | ### **Launch and commercialization**
123 | 
124 | Launch isn’t just a technical milestone—it’s a company-wide effort. GTM teams need enablement materials. Support needs documentation. Sales needs demos. Marketing needs to make a big splash—and the list goes on.
125 | 
126 | ##### A well-orchestrated launch makes a product feel polished, credible, and ready for the market it’s entering.
127 | 
128 | ### **Post-launch monitoring and maintenance**
129 | 
130 | The PDLC doesn’t end at launch. Real-world usage often reveals edge cases and pressing fixes that need to be implemented.
131 | 
132 | Fortunately, there’s countless [product management tools](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-management-tools) that help support this work, including Amplitude, Mixpanel, and Fullstory.
133 | 
134 | ## **Why a well-defined PDLC matters**
135 | 
136 | Without a shared framework, product development becomes reactive. Work is rushed, the scope is unclear, and features are misaligned with market needs.
137 | 
138 | A clearly-defined PDLC helps teams:
139 | 
140 | - **Align around outcomes:** Everyone knows what success looks like and how to get there
141 | 
142 | - **Surface complexity early:** Your team can flag potential feature or function limitations early on, allowing them to get address on time
143 | 
144 | - **Deliver predictably:** Clear stage gates and decision points reduce surprises
145 | 
146 | - **Improve quality:** Fewer bugs, better UX, and more maintainable code

150 | ## **Best practices for managing the product development lifecycle**
151 | 
152 | Even with a PDLC, teams often face challenges like delayed roadmaps and communication silos.
153 | 
154 | To handle these complexities and maintain agility, modern product teams can adopt several best practices:
155 | 
156 | ### **Prioritize cross-functional collaboration from the start**
157 | 
158 | Ensure representatives from product, engineering, design, and GTM teams are involved from the earliest stages. This shared understanding prevents downstream misalignments and ensures all perspectives are considered for a well-designed product.
159 | 
160 | _Related:_ [_Best practices for building a product roadmap_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-roadmap-examples)
161 | 
162 | ### **Think about integrations as a core part of the product, not a feature**
163 | 
164 | Your product will almost certainly require [product integrations with complementary SaaS solutions](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations).
165 | 
166 | Assuming yours isn't an outlier, you’ll need to treat integrations with the same strategic importance as core product functionalities.
167 | 
168 | Plan for them from day one, design their UX as an integral part of the user journey, and allocate resources for their development and maintenance to ensure seamless interoperability.
169 | 
170 | ### **Use AI to automate as much of the work as possible**
171 | 
172 | AI tools can help each team manage their respective PDLC tasks faster.
173 | 
174 | Developers can use AI to generate boilerplate code; product managers can get detailed analysis from user feedback to identify features that need to be prioritized; designers can generate UI mockups from simple text prompts, and the list goes on!
175 | 
176 | ### **Set clear stage gates and decision points**
177 | 
178 | Define clear criteria for moving from one PDLC stage to the next. These "stage gates" ensure necessary activities are completed and key decisions are made before committing further resources.
179 | 
180 | ## **Accelerate your PDLC with Merge**
181 | 
182 | Product integrations can derail your product launches, as they can take engineers months to build.
183 | 
184 | Fortunately, you can quickly launch a cutting-edge product with all the integrations your users need by leveraging Merge.
185 | 
186 | Merge offers a single API that lets your users access hundreds of cross-category integrations, making integrations not just easy to build but also a key differentiator for your product.

 53 | 
 54 | We’ll help you do both by walking through several real-world examples.
 55 | 
 56 | But first, let’s align on what a product experience (PX) strategy is and why it’s important.

107 | ## **What is a product experience strategy?**
108 | 
109 | It’s the process of collecting qualitative and quantitative customer feedback, setting a goal based on that feedback, executing against that goal, and measuring success over time.
110 | 
111 | [![Steps for creating a product experience strategy ](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67db1c76b17074afc2be6547_Product%20experience%20strategy%20overview.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67db1c76b17074afc2be6547_Product%20experience%20strategy%20overview.png)
112 | 
113 | Your product experience strategies essentially serve as the north star for making the product improvements you need to support a best-in-market solution.
114 | 
115 | _Related:_ [_What is a product roadmap?_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-roadmap-examples)
116 | 
117 | ## **How to develop a product experience strategy**
118 | 
119 | We’ll break down each of the steps you need to take to implement a product experience strategy and use an example each step of the way to make it more tangible.
120 | 
121 | ### **1\. Collect and analyze customer data**
122 | 
123 | You’ll need to start by assessing the top churn factors and upsell/cross-sell opportunities.
124 | 
125 | To get the full picture of these opportunities, you can tap into a variety of sources:
126 | 
127 | - Survey relevant customers (e.g., customers who are churning) and go-to-market teams
128 | - Use data in your CRM (e.g., closed-lost reasons) to get quantitative insights
129 | - Look at product usage data to uncover trending issues related to product and feature adoption
130 | - Review the competitive landscape to see which features can give you a meaningful edge or—if neglected—leave you behind
131 | - Analyze customer support tickets to find recurring problems
132 | 
133 | For example, [OneRange](https://www.onerange.co/), a learning and development platform, needed to offer HRIS integrations with their product to help customers automatically assign the right courses to the right employees on time.
134 | 
135 | However, through customer research, they found that their file-based HRIS integrations—where customers would continually export files from their HRISs and import them into OneRange—were tedious and time consuming for customers. They could also lead to human errors that would compromise OneRange's ability to deliver learning resources to employees on time.
136 | 
137 | ### **2\. Create a product objective(s)**
138 | 
139 | Once you’ve identified the top opportunity, you can use a framework that lets you make it actionable—such as SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound).
140 | 
141 | Continuing with our OneRange example, they landed on the following SMART goal to provide reliable and automated HRIS integrations: offer 50+ API-based HRIS integrations within 3 weeks.
142 | 
143 | _Related:_ [_How to come up with product objectives_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-objectives)
144 | 
145 | ### **3\. Determine how to execute against the objective**
146 | 
147 | You’ll need to decide whether to implement the solution through internal resources or outsource it.
148 | 
149 | This involves understanding your team’s current skill sets, the opportunity costs associated with an internal implementation (i.e., what product initiatives would need to be deprioritized), whether there are ongoing resourcing needs following an internal implementation, and so on.
150 | 
151 | When OneRange navigated the decision to build or outsource their HRIS integrations, they landed on the former (they partnered with Merge) because it would allow their limited engineering capacity to be fully invested on their core product over time. It would also allow them to launch all of the HRIS integrations they needed within the timeframe their customers and prospects wanted.
152 | 
153 | ### **4\. Analyze results early and iterate quickly**
154 | 
155 | Regardless of the approach you take, you'll need to measure your progress frequently to see if things are on track and if you need to course correct. That could mean setting time and/or event-based check-ins for your team.
156 | 
157 | For OneRange, their check-in was relatively easy. Since they used a time-bound product objective that was fairly short, they were able to measure their progress quickly; in other words, they measured the number of API-based HRIS integrations they were able to offer at the 3 week mark.
158 | 
159 | They actually executed against this goal just within that timeframe— [here’s a case study](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/onerange) that talks about it—so they didn’t need to make any changes.
160 | 
161 | _Note: As your customers’ and prospects’ expectations for your product evolve, you may find that your existing product experience strategies will need to be fine tuned, if not altered. Whenever this happens to a given strategy, you can follow steps 1 through 4 above to update it._
162 | 
163 | ## **Examples of product experience strategies**
164 | 
165 | To make these steps more actionable, let’s walk through how a few real-world companies have implemented product experience strategies.
166 | 
167 | ### **Acctual made a key workflow improvement to increase product adoption**
168 | 
169 | [Acctual](https://www.acctual.com/), which offers a platform that lets you pay and invoice in crypto, noticed that many users weren’t completing the invoice creation workflow in their product.
170 | 
171 | After looking at their customer behavior more closely, they found that it was because users didn’t know they had to create a contact first; users were populating the invoice and trying to create it only to get an error message that they needed to create a contact (which was on a separate page).
172 | 
173 | After discovering this, the team at Acctual added copy within the product’s UI to clarify that the user needs to create a contact before an associated invoice. They also separated the invoice creation and contact creation workflows.
174 | 
175 | [![Screenshot of customer creation workflow in Acctual](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67cef6dcd90be0f1e6aa4a87_AD_4nXdhjcuxeW_2HyAG9tot_wJX-MUkpv9cgzY4MI8DPzDyqWRgtUa3_K2wU-qf-LiUwKYNuk9xhmurXMcVpxuBMEFgSbduSRDoSrySG58HsXU41TLJSmoqtDz6GaL3gLF8o2vEAIJvag.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67cef6dcd90be0f1e6aa4a87_AD_4nXdhjcuxeW_2HyAG9tot_wJX-MUkpv9cgzY4MI8DPzDyqWRgtUa3_K2wU-qf-LiUwKYNuk9xhmurXMcVpxuBMEFgSbduSRDoSrySG58HsXU41TLJSmoqtDz6GaL3gLF8o2vEAIJvag.png)
176 | 
177 | _Actual’s customers are prompted to create a customer, or contact, before creating an invoice for them_
178 | 
179 | Since implementing this solution, they saw a dramatic improvement in their invoice creation completion rate—giving them confidence that they were on the right track.

182 | 
183 | ### **Causal built an “AI Wizard” to improve their platform’s time-to-value**
184 | 
185 | [Causal](https://www.causal.app/), a financial planning platform, found that users were a bit slow to adopt their solution, which was eventually leading to churn.
186 | 
187 | To tackle this, they built an “AI Wizard” that uses [customers’ ERP data](https://www.merge.dev/blog/erp-api-integration) to populate customizable financial models.

246 | ### **Assembly integrated with several file storage solutions to power their enterprise AI search**
247 | 
248 | [Assembly](https://www.joinassembly.com/), an HR software platform, found that their customers wanted them to offer an enterprise AI search solution that could answer employees’ work-related questions in plain text.
249 | 
250 | To do this, they needed to [implement customer-facing file storage integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/file-storage-api) for all the providers their customers use—Google Drive, Box, Dropbox, Sharepoint, and OneDrive.
251 | 
252 | They initially tried implementing these integrations internally but found the process of having their engineers build and maintain them to be extremely complex and time consuming. For example, the process of building these integrations with access control levels (ACLs)—so that users can only access the information from documents that meet their level of permissions—proved extremely difficult.
253 | 
254 | With this in mind, they decided to outsource their file storage integrations to Merge, which allowed them to add all the ones they needed within a few weeks.

257 | 
258 | _Assembly, an HR platform, offers an enterprise AI search that uses information from customers' files to generate answers with plain text and links_
259 | 
260 | Since building their enterprise AI search, they’ve improved their Net Promoter Score®, experienced higher product usage, and unblocked several deals—all of which give them confidence that the implementation was a success.
261 | 
262 | ## **Why you need a product experience strategy**
263 | 
264 | In case you or your team need more convincing, a product experience strategy is critical for several reasons:
265 | 
266 | ### **Elevates your team’s ability to execute**
267 | 
268 | Your product likely has several areas for improvement. Trying to tackle them all at once can stretch your limited resources thin, resulting in burn out across your team and poor execution.
269 | 
270 | A product experience strategy helps address this by keeping your team focused on the product improvements that matter most to your customers and prospects.
271 | 
272 | ### **Enables you to build a customer-centric product**
273 | 
274 | Customer feedback is at the core of any product experience strategy.
275 | 
276 | As a result, executing any effectively lets you build the product features and functionality your customers truly need to realize value from your platform.
277 | 
278 | ### **Gives your organization a competitive advantage**
279 | 
280 | According to [research by Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-2024-us-customer-experience-index/), just 3% of companies are customer-obsessed (i.e., they prioritize their customers’ needs).
281 | 
282 | Product experience strategies serve as a forcing function to make and keep your platform customer-centric. This gives your product an edge over all of your rivals, who likely (based on the data point above) prioritize other areas, such as short-term revenue gains.
283 | 
284 | ### **Accounts for the full product lifecycle**
285 | 
286 | A product experience strategy can include any part of the customer’s experience with your solution—from onboarding to off-boarding.
287 | 
288 | As a result, it lets you focus on the product areas that truly matter the most and that allow you to build a more powerful, end-to-end solution.
289 | 
290 | ### **Improves your bottom line**
291 | 
292 | A well thought out and implemented PX strategy can ultimately improve your revenue. Case in point: [Bain & Company found](https://www.bain.com/insights/are-you-experienced-infographic/) that organizations that deliver a great customer experience grow 4-8% faster in their respective market.
293 | 
294 | ## **Execute a best-in-class product experience strategy with Merge**
295 |

 49 | 
 50 | We’ve seen firsthand how customer data can help companies power creative and powerful AI features in their products—from identifying and recommending high-fit sales leads to generating customizable financial models.
 51 | 
 52 | But accessing and using customer data securely—via product integrations—to power these features can prove difficult.
 53 | 
 54 | You can read on to learn how you can support highly-secure product integrations across your customer base.
 55 | 
 56 | ## **Prevent outputs that include sensitive data**
 57 | 
 58 | A lot of the customer data that’s synced can include personally identifiable information (PII), like social security numbers.
 59 | 
 60 | Without the proper precautions in place, you can unintentionally feed these types of data to the large language model (LLM) you use, leading it to generate outputs that include this information.
 61 | 
 62 | For example, if you offer an [enterprise AI search solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-enterprise-search) and a user asks something like “What’s my colleague Mike’s social security number?”, the LLM can generate an output that includes the number.
 63 | 
 64 | [![RAG example for generating Mike's social security number](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67c5e9b93ae26a7ab9ddf902_AD_4nXf_fq3kweoQMPUjyCynJBvzpSRNMtLTXKC5TaEr31X3bi81mHD1zsj6XbjW1lIV7LapnMklKClgeIWNsZhRYmCQ1EVSTyBL6xlqAZZa4x7ED-ckkslApIDr0nLSPzSRMZHUyKtDfQ.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67c5e9b93ae26a7ab9ddf902_AD_4nXf_fq3kweoQMPUjyCynJBvzpSRNMtLTXKC5TaEr31X3bi81mHD1zsj6XbjW1lIV7LapnMklKClgeIWNsZhRYmCQ1EVSTyBL6xlqAZZa4x7ED-ckkslApIDr0nLSPzSRMZHUyKtDfQ.webp)
 65 | 
 66 | To address this proactively, you can provide scopes—or the ability for either you or your customers to toggle off the specific fields that customers don’t want you to access and sync.

 77 | 
 78 | ## **Provide controls on who can access certain types of data**
 79 | 
 80 | In cases where you need your AI feature to generate outputs with sensitive information but you only want that information to be available to certain individuals, you can bake access control lists (ACLs) into your product integrations.
 81 | 
 82 | For example, say you have documents related to your company’s financials that you only want executives and members of your finance team to access and work off of.
 83 | 
 84 | Using ACLs, the integrations will only feed the data from these documents to the LLM _when_ the user who’s trying to access it in your product has the right set of permissions.
 85 | 
 86 | We’ve seen first hand how powerful this security feature can be.
 87 | 
 88 | [Ema](https://www.ema.co/), which offers agents that can complete a wide range of tasks on behalf of employees, uses ACLs for the file storage integrations they offer through Merge.

 96 | ## **Perform frequent syncs to avoid unauthorized data access**
 97 | 
 98 | As your team changes permissions on files, reports, dashboards and more over time, they’ll need to ensure that those changes are enforced effectively over time.
 99 | 
100 | To help facilitate this, you can set your integrations to make frequent GET requests (e.g., daily re-syncs).
101 | 
102 | The re-synced data will only get shown to employees who actively meet the relevant permission levels in the integrated system; while the employees who no longer meet these permissions won’t have access to the data.

110 | ## **Build and sustain customer trust**
111 | 
112 | Your customers may not be fully comfortable with providing sensitive data to whatever LLM you use until they learn about and approve of the level of security provided by the underlying integrations.
113 | 
114 | To that end, being able to offer product integrations that comply with key data privacy and protection laws and regulations, like GDPR, offer strong encryption protocols (e.g., encrypting data at rest and in transit), store data in secured data centers, and more can go a long way in meeting customers’ expectations.

 51 | 
 52 | An effective product integration strategy requires your team to identify the biggest integration opportunities over time and pursue them strategically and sustainably.
 53 | 
 54 | To help you do this, we’ve laid out several best practices worth following.
 55 | 
 56 | ## **Align on your goal(s) for offering product integrations**
 57 | 
 58 | [Product integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations) can serve a variety of needs. They can help increase customer retention; enable your reps to close more deals; support your ability to expand into new markets, and more.
 59 | 
 60 | [![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67858c956a94a8086d36fe02_6627eb109b9cd1ea9111ba0e_Screenshot%25202024-04-23%2520at%25201.08.21%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67858c956a94a8086d36fe02_6627eb109b9cd1ea9111ba0e_Screenshot%25202024-04-23%2520at%25201.08.21%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)
 61 | 
 62 | _More than half of B2B SaaS organizations,_ [_according to our State of Product Integrations_](https://www.merge.dev/learning/state-of-product-integrations-2024) _, cite improved close rates, higher customer retention, and expanding to new markets as benefits of providing product integrations_
 63 | 
 64 | Determining the goals that matter most to your business at a given point in time can help your team prioritize the integrations that get built first—and those that get built later.
 65 | 
 66 | For example, if your goal is to move upmarket and prospects at larger accounts are requesting integrations with NetSuite and Microsoft Dynamics 365, you might prioritize these integrations over accounting systems that other segments of prospects request.
 67 | 
 68 | That said, it’s worth reviewing your goals on a predefined cadence (e.g., every 6 months) so that your goals and the integrations you’re planning on building short-term stay aligned over time.
 69 | 
 70 | _Related:_ [_How product managers can implement integrations_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-manager-integrations)
 71 | 
 72 | ## **Analyze integration requests on aggregate**
 73 | 
 74 | You might have certain sales reps or prospects repeatedly say that they want specific integrations added to your product, while less vocal sales reps or prospects want other integrations added. This can bias your integration roadmap in favor of “the loudest people in the room”, while “the silent majority” are left without the integrations they want and need.
 75 | 
 76 | To prevent bias and allow everyone to weigh in, you can collect and review integration requests at scale.
 77 | 
 78 | For instance, you can:
 79 | 
 80 | - Survey clients, prospects, reps, and customer success managers about the integrations they’re interested in. You can even ask them to stack rank the integrations to help you pinpoint the most lucrative opportunities
 81 | 
 82 | - Create reports in your CRM that allow you to see the opportunities that have been lost due to specific integrations not being available. In addition, you can create a report to see the customers that have requested certain integrations
 83 | 
 84 | - Track how often specific integrations get mentioned on sales calls, by whom, and when (a tool like Gong can help with this)
 85 | 
 86 | Adopting these approaches, either in combination or in isolation, can help you build a product integration roadmap that best fits the needs of your business.
 87 | 
 88 | ## **Assess the integrations' ease of implementation via APIs**
 89 | 
 90 | Aside from their business value, integrations can also differ significantly by their level of difficulty to build.
 91 | 
 92 | Some of the factors that can influence this include:
 93 | 
 94 | ### **Quality of API documentation**
 95 | 
 96 | Some API providers offer comprehensive, up-to-date documentation that can answer any of your questions, whether that’s on rate limits, pagination, authentication, etc; while other providers can fail to update their documentation over time and/or don't cover key aspects of building to their endpoints.
 97 | 
 98 | _All else equal, the worse the API documentation quality is for a given provider, the lower that build should fall in your list of integration priorities._
 99 | 
100 | ### **Endpoint accessibility**
101 | 
102 | In certain cases, an API provider might not provide the endpoints you need. Whenever that’s true, you’ll need to turn to alternative approaches to integration, such as [using flat files](https://www.merge.dev/blog/flat-file-integration) or screen scraping. And since these other methods often come with significant drawbacks—from not syncing data in frequent intervals to failing frequently—the integration build may not be worth the effort.
103 | 
104 | _All else equal, if an API provider doesn’t provide the endpoints you need, the build should fall lower in your list of integration priorities._
105 | 
106 | _Related:_ [_How to build a product strategy for implementing AI_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy)
107 | 
108 | ## **Implement the infrastructure and processes for maintaining the integrations**
109 | 
110 | Once an integration is built, your engineers' workload will only grow. To help them maintain the integrations successfully, you’ll need to have systems and processes in place that can help your engineers pinpoint issues quickly and troubleshoot and resolve them with little delay.
111 | 
112 | With this in mind, you should determine how, exactly, you want to support your integrations. And once you’ve come up with your “game plan”, you should present it to key internal stakeholders in engineering and customer success so that everyone can be aligned and take the necessary steps to put it into action.
113 | 
114 | Here are some of the factors to consider when building out your integration maintenance and management strategy:
115 | 
116 | - **Tooling:** pick out and implement specific applications (e.g., Datadog) that can collect [logs](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-logs) of your API requests and help your team detect issues
117 | 
118 | - **Roles and responsibilities:** defining the specific integration issues that certain engineers are responsible for can help foster areas of specialization and distribute the workload more evenly. Moreover, outlining the role customer success plays can allow for smoother handoffs and faster time-to-resolutions **‍**
119 | 
120 | - **Workflows:** think through internal workflows that can help your engineers become aware of issues sooner and work on resolving them faster. For instance, you can connect your monitoring application with Slack to send automated notifications in a specific channel whenever issues arise
121 | 
122 | [![Automated issue notification workflow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67858c956a94a8086d36fdfd_6627efa74da6ceb914ab841b_Screenshot%25202024-04-23%2520at%25201.27.48%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67858c956a94a8086d36fdfd_6627efa74da6ceb914ab841b_Screenshot%25202024-04-23%2520at%25201.27.48%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)
123 | 
124 | _You can also send automated issue alerts to specific email addresses_

 48 | Product integrations offer a wealth of benefits, from [improving customer retention](https://www.profitwell.com/integration-benchmarks) to helping you [close new business](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/digital-markets/documents/ebook-global-software-buyer-trends-survey-insights-for-2022.pdf).
 49 | 
 50 | As a result, the question isn’t if you should build product integrations—it’s how you go about building them.
 51 | 
 52 | We’ll help you pinpoint different ways of building product integrations so that you can determine which makes the most sense for your organization. But to start, let’s align on our definition of product integrations and go deeper on why they’re important.
 53 | 
 54 | _Related:_ [_How product managers can build integrations_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-manager-integrations)
 55 | 
 56 | ## ‍ **Definition of product integrations**
 57 | 
 58 | Product integrations are any integrations your platform provides with 3rd-party systems. They typically use application programming interfaces (APIs) to ensure the integrated data moves quickly and reliably, but they can also be powered by webhooks for real-time syncs.
 59 | 
 60 | Note: Product integrations and [customer-facing integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/customer-facing-integration) mean the same thing. We'll stick with the former term in this article.
 61 | 
 62 | ## **Why are product integrations important?**
 63 | 
 64 | Here are some of the top benefits of product integrations:
 65 | 
 66 | ### **Enables you to acquire more customers**
 67 | 
 68 | Your prospects may have several criteria when evaluating your software alongside alternatives. That said, integrations likely top their list of wants. Case in point: [a study by Gartner](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/digital-markets/documents/ebook-global-software-buyer-trends-survey-insights-for-2022.pdf) found that more than 4 in 5 buyers rate a vendor’s ability to provide “seamless integrations” as very important.
 69 | 
 70 | ### **Helps you expand into new markets**
 71 | 
 72 | As you look to move upmarket, sell into additional regions, or enter more industries, you’ll likely face new integration demands. If you can meet them and go above and beyond what the market incumbents offer, you have a chance to not only gain traction but also become a market leader.
 73 | 
 74 | _Related:_ [_Benefits of API aggregation_](https://merge.dev/blog/api-aggregator)
 75 | 
 76 | ### **Facilitates more customer expansions**
 77 | 
 78 | Given their value, product integrations are easy to monetize.
 79 | 
 80 | You can sell the integrations as add-ons, as part of higher-end packages, or even include a specific set of integrations in one package while adding additional ones in another. We’ve seen our clients adopt any one of these approaches successfully. For instance, [TeamOhana](https://www.teamohana.com/), a headcount management platform, includes integrations in their Enterprise package.
 81 | 
 82 | ‍
 83 | 
 84 | [![How TeamOhana uses integrations in their pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c801dfc46ccb9bf8ae0568_TeamOhana%27s%20pricing%20page.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c801dfc46ccb9bf8ae0568_TeamOhana%27s%20pricing%20page.webp)
 85 | 
 86 | On the other hand, [Causal](https://www.causal.app/), a modern business planning software, offers a Google Sheets integration in their Free plan, standard data integrations in their Launch plan, and premium integrations in their Growth plan.
 87 | 
 88 | [![How Causal uses integrations across different price points](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c8021ee4a4d5fe6cf21d03_Causal%20Pricing%20page.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c8021ee4a4d5fe6cf21d03_Causal%20Pricing%20page.webp)
 89 | 
 90 | ### ‍ **Allows you to retain clients at a higher rate**
 91 | 
 92 | Perhaps unsurprisingly, integration issues are the [leading cause of customer churn](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/digital-markets/documents/software-market-guide-project-management.pdf). Put differently, providing reliable and comprehensive product integrations can help prevent client dissatisfaction that leads to lost business.

101 | 
102 | ## **Approaches to implementing product integrations**
103 | 
104 | Now that you know why product integrations are important, the next question you’re likely asking is how, exactly, you can go about implementing them.
105 | 
106 | We’ll present a few options to help guide your evaluation.
107 | 
108 | ### **In-house development**
109 | 
110 | This involves tasking your in-house developers with building to 3rd-party APIs and maintaining the connections.
111 | 
112 | [![A visual representation of native integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f7a1ba75ef75afe04f_DH7Wk851OSYwQ-ZWe93ncg7CDUc1n4csBbl9_ZHRYX3z1vFghCBacSdAuzhCdg5bJbl1pdTVPHi6p45qxW9iA4nBeEe_yzRgFbK5y1omh4DCO2eTDK7JBckjbNWm_ynXbgM33bx_-CGXZWn6EQrC7ew.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f7a1ba75ef75afe04f_DH7Wk851OSYwQ-ZWe93ncg7CDUc1n4csBbl9_ZHRYX3z1vFghCBacSdAuzhCdg5bJbl1pdTVPHi6p45qxW9iA4nBeEe_yzRgFbK5y1omh4DCO2eTDK7JBckjbNWm_ynXbgM33bx_-CGXZWn6EQrC7ew.webp)
113 | 
114 | There are certainly some benefits to this approach. For instance, it allows you to avoid working with 3rd-parties. In addition, it can prove manageable if you only need to build one integration or the integrations you need to build are relatively shallow in scope.
115 | 
116 | However, in reality, you’ll likely need to implement and maintain an ever-growing set of robust integrations. Tasking your developers with this would take up most of (if not all of) their time, forcing them to forgo other critical work, such as addressing product bugs or developing key features for your product.
117 | 
118 | ### **Embedded integration platform as a service (iPaaS)**
119 | 
120 | An [embedded iPaaS](https://merge.dev/blog/embedded-ipaas) is a 3rd-party solution that allows you to embed a provider’s iPaaS into your platform.
121 | 
122 | The platform typically provides multiple deployment options. For instance, you can either build the integrations on behalf of clients or allow them to do so within your platform.
123 | 
124 | [![A visual representation of an embedded iPaaS](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f6636838057079bb24_fDzCBNbPLhd3K7XnzjhzqGZbGtROnV4h7JyymDtXdYiB45FcJ7s_jcLeP5M2uKcX-28w0QMbcI2MtVe2U-_eRP6JQ9nxS1EQXDvZ35ROpwNCnz28zd48rTFD-4cpyXFmVOD1cf-J30f4fu5_Sd6GFLs.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f6636838057079bb24_fDzCBNbPLhd3K7XnzjhzqGZbGtROnV4h7JyymDtXdYiB45FcJ7s_jcLeP5M2uKcX-28w0QMbcI2MtVe2U-_eRP6JQ9nxS1EQXDvZ35ROpwNCnz28zd48rTFD-4cpyXFmVOD1cf-J30f4fu5_Sd6GFLs.webp)
125 | 
126 | ‍
127 | 
128 | And while embedded iPaaS solutions are a step in the right direction, they don’t fully address the issues presented in in-house development.
129 | 
130 | They still require a fair amount of technical expertise to use—ultimately forcing your engineers (or your clients’) to build and manage the integrations. In addition, you’ll only be able to build one integration at a time, making the prospect of launching a high-volume of integrations quickly all but impossible.
131 | 
132 | _Related:_ [_How to decide between an Embedded iPaaS and a unified API_](https://merge.dev/blog/embedded-ipaas-vs-unified-api)
133 | 
134 | ### **Unified API solution**
135 | 
136 | A [unified API platform](https://merge.dev/blog/what-is-a-unified-api) is a 3rd-party solution that offers a suite of aggregated APIs; each aggregated—or unified—API allows you to connect to multiple 3rd-party solutions in a given software category, such as a CRM.
137 | 
138 | [![A visual representation of a unified API platform](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f780703460354fbe5b_OXoHHcLWwylRi0lmS2vjAjbA7e2SMuZ3rcGoExrwrKIVrRXR3eal9WRh2DKfKuT-ZYbWxLXK5myOZsQLOMjwuSTusyQ9PPNoSbkUggY6uZT4eOmgNmbVYuz_GDUkMmH-JHJkZWFOILtYI8lWs0cl-BQ.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/64c800f780703460354fbe5b_OXoHHcLWwylRi0lmS2vjAjbA7e2SMuZ3rcGoExrwrKIVrRXR3eal9WRh2DKfKuT-ZYbWxLXK5myOZsQLOMjwuSTusyQ9PPNoSbkUggY6uZT4eOmgNmbVYuz_GDUkMmH-JHJkZWFOILtYI8lWs0cl-BQ.webp)
139 | 
140 | ‍
141 | 
142 | This type of platform neatly addresses the drawbacks presented in the other options: namely, you can integrate at scale with minimal effort. For instance, Merge lets you connect to more than 40 ATS vendors by simply connecting to its [ATS Unified API](https://merge.dev/categories/ats-recruiting-api).
143 | 
144 | But Merge goes beyond other unified API platforms in a number of other ways.
145 | 
146 | We offer 7 unified APIs (and growing) to ensure you’re able to scale any type of integration; we provide comprehensive common models across our unified APIs, in addition to features that allow you to access custom fields and objects; we have out-of-the-box [integrations management capabilities](https://merge.dev/features/integrations-management) to help your team assess clients’ integration activities and health as well as assist end-users on resolving their integration issues.
147 | 
148 | To learn more about Merge, you can [schedule a demo with one of our integration experts](https://merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fproduct-integrations).
149 | 
150 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 50 | As a product manager, you likely own a broad scope of work, from developing and managing roadmaps to running market and user research to analyzing feature adoption and iterating based on gleaned insights.
 51 | 
 52 | Given everything on your plate, you’ll likely need a large and constantly evolving set of tools to help execute on your goals.
 53 | 
 54 | We’ll break down the current list of tools worth leveraging, but let’s start by aligning on what product management tools look like in 2025.
 55 | 
 56 | ## **What are product management tools?**
 57 | 
 58 | A product management tool is any software that can help a PM build, launch, iterate, or scale a product or an aspect of a product, such as an integration, a security measure, or an AI feature.
 59 | 
 60 | [![Overview of product management tools](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d7b3306ecba6cbb810_AD_4nXcAFHEZw7pPiEQBkihzfYu0q7UjxJxzhr2kBc0RsQe8jdoOfyMhzurqBg-CjazoxCRGYa4eanzrqk4ksUTL6pbXzNPFfdAIu585xhF_CSfmILqLWzU3vLl07h81X4A_e27_H72_bA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d7b3306ecba6cbb810_AD_4nXcAFHEZw7pPiEQBkihzfYu0q7UjxJxzhr2kBc0RsQe8jdoOfyMhzurqBg-CjazoxCRGYa4eanzrqk4ksUTL6pbXzNPFfdAIu585xhF_CSfmILqLWzU3vLl07h81X4A_e27_H72_bA.png)
 61 | 
 62 | _A snapshot of popular product management software categories and tools. Many of these tools fall into multiple categories_
 63 | 
 64 | _Related:_ [_What is an AI product strategy? Plus, how to implement one effectively_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy)
 65 | 
 66 | ## **Core categories of product management tools**
 67 | 
 68 | Let’s take a closer look at the popular categories.
 69 | 
 70 | - **Roadmapping and strategy:** These tools let you develop and edit your [product roadmaps](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-roadmap-examples) across product lines and features. They also often include project management functionality (and if they don’t, they integrate with project management tools) to ensure key tasks get assigned and executed on time
 71 | 
 72 | - **User research and feedback:** You can use these tools to survey users within your product to gather timely, contextual feedback, see how users interact with your product organically, gather hard-to-reach panels and ask them questions related to your current or planned products or features
 73 | 
 74 | - **Collaboration and documentation:** These tools allow you to highlight the features and/or products you’re building, how you’re implementing them, your plans for building them, and more. You can also use these tools to lay out key cross-functional processes, such as how sprints are performed
 75 | 
 76 | Whatever you end up adding to these platforms should be visible to cross-functional partners and offer them the chance to make comments, perform edits, and add their own notes.
 77 | 
 78 | - **Analytics and product intelligence:** You can leverage these platforms to understand if and how users interact with certain product features, which can help you pinpoint opportunities—if any—for improvement. These platforms also allow you to perform more robust analysis on certain features’ functionality by letting you perform A/B tests, segment your analysis by a specific cohort, and more
 79 | 
 80 | - **Collaboration & Documentation:** These solutions allow you to lay out product specs, [craft product objectives](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-objectives) for certain initiatives, work with design on landing pages, and much more. Essentially, these tools are where you align with cross-functional teams on your product strategy and work with them on specific tasks that fall under your product roadmap
 81 | 
 82 | 
 83 | - **Integration and API Management:** The former type of solution lets you add integrations to your product more easily and can support your team in maintaining them, while the latter lets you manage your product’s API endpoints. In short, they serve different integration use cases but both allow you to support integrations with your product
 84 | - **AI:** The AI solutions for product managers is fast-evolving, but it includes a combination of mainstream [AI chatbots](https://www.merge.dev/blog/how-to-build-ai-chatbot), like ChatGPT, and AI features and functionality that’s included in tools within our other categories. For example, a tool within analytics and product intelligence can use AI to provide product managers with intelligent predictions on whether a certain feature change will influence a usage metric

 87 | 
 88 | ## **The best product management tools**

246 | ## **How to select the right tools for your team**
247 | 
248 | Given all the tools available, the process of evaluating and selecting the best ones for your organization can be daunting.
249 | 
250 | To help you navigate this exercise successfully, here are a few steps you can take.
251 | 
252 | [![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d674e270c5199f2359_AD_4nXfHT21MPtT-OeKbm7Xrt7P1RGFa7oTq2iyh4kJ7Zsy1d2KkIXghzuDezywPAg4aab16vf1UHsAVrCo-11W9uvmKAeWacmd8vnzEjS-l-jNEOnkkqLHtnfw2eH3X3bEjUX1B7sLt.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d674e270c5199f2359_AD_4nXfHT21MPtT-OeKbm7Xrt7P1RGFa7oTq2iyh4kJ7Zsy1d2KkIXghzuDezywPAg4aab16vf1UHsAVrCo-11W9uvmKAeWacmd8vnzEjS-l-jNEOnkkqLHtnfw2eH3X3bEjUX1B7sLt.png)
253 | 
254 | _You can follow the steps above any time your team needs a certain type of tool_
255 | 
256 | ### **Define your objective**
257 | 
258 | This step is obvious but it’s critical in not only narrowing down the category of tooling you need but also the particular tools you should look at.
259 | 
260 | Here are just some examples of goals you can adopt:
261 | 
262 | - **Monitor product usage metrics that allow us to accurately assess a given feature’s performance— and improve upon it—over time.** You can also define the metrics you care about, like feature engagement count and feature use frequency, to help you pin down the product analytics tools that track these metrics
263 | 
264 | 
265 | - **Integrate with the 10 most requested ticketing solutions and file storage applications.** This lets you whittle down the integration solutions by those that support these integrations
266 | 
267 | Your goal can also help inform your Request for Proposal (RFP) document, which will be critical at later stages of this process.

274 | 
275 | ### **Define requirements based on team maturity**
276 | 
277 | Once you know the type of tool you need and are able to narrow down your list, you should reflect on the specific PMs on your team who’d use them and ask yourself the following:
278 | 
279 | - How technical are they?
280 | - How specialized are their roles?
281 | - How much capacity do they have?
282 | 
283 | The answers to these questions can help you better suss out the features your team will actually use and need now and which aren’t as appropriate (at least for the time being). You can also gather direct feedback from your team to pressure test your hypotheses.
284 | 
285 | ### **Compare features, integrations, and support**
286 | 
287 | Based on the RFP you put together, you can directly compare the solutions’ with one another along the criteria that matters most.
288 | 
289 | If possible, you should also participate in free trials with each solution to validate that their features and integrations work as advertised and that their support team is responsive and helpful. Based on this hands-on experience, you’ll likely know which solution is the best one for your team.
290 | 
291 | ### **Pilot and validate internally**
292 | 
293 | Finally, you should select a tool for a proof of concept to actually execute on your use cases. As part of this process, you should negotiate an out-clause in case the tool ultimately proves to be a bad fit.
294 | 
295 | Assuming it works—and it likely will, given all the steps you followed—it’ll be a key tool in your product team’s tech stack.
296 | 
297 | ### **Final thoughts**
298 | 
299 | Given that your product team’s responsibilities have likely grown over time, you’ll need to adopt a broad set of tools to empower them.
300 | 
301 | If you can follow the steps above to identify and invest in best-in-class tooling across the board, you’re giving your team, and by extension your product, a competitive advantage in the years to come.

 46 | Product integrations, or integrations that are built between your product and your customers’ applications, are a critical way for SaaS companies to generate more revenue.
 47 | 
 48 | Case in point: Through [our State of Product Integrations report](https://www.merge.dev/learning/state-of-product-integrations-2024), which involved surveying hundreds of PMs and engineers, we learned that product integrations help more than half of SaaS companies reduce churn, increase new business sales, and expand to new markets.

 51 | 
 52 | To reap these benefits over time, we’ll break down specific tactics to [implement and maintain product integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations) successfully.
 53 | 
 54 | ## **Adopt a scoring methodology to prioritize your integration requests**
 55 | 
 56 | Your engineers likely can’t handle more than a handful of integration requests at a time, which means that you'll need to pick and choose the integrations that get prioritized.
 57 | 
 58 | To prioritize requests strategically and objectively, you can score them against several variables:
 59 | 
 60 | - **The number of customers and/or prospects requesting an integration.** In other words, the relative level of demand for an integration.
 61 | 
 62 | - **The specific companies that request an integration.** Generally speaking, the larger the accounts that request an integration are, the higher your score should be (as they’ll likely be willing and able to spend more on them).
 63 | 
 64 | - **The level of difficulty in building an integration.** You can suss out how long it’ll take your developers to build the integration by reviewing the API provider’s documentation, getting feedback from other developers in online forums, etc.
 65 | 
 66 | Note: There may be other factors worth considering as you review and compare integration requests. The guidance on this page is just meant to help you start building your own assessment methodology.
 67 | 
 68 | Once you know the answers to these questions for a given integration and can assign specific ranges for each criteria that correspond to certain values (e.g., 0, 1, 2), you can score each integration.
 69 | 
 70 | [![Integration request assessments](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6638e4dae6496be06435aa4a_USIOcl8g4dlkCPV6D8c01F8oPwOFs7dTw7J9vsBPUjIgv-DtfOds8DBpq3k-8qN9Z947jqi-yhP3R3VHI0TKYp7_0KbNgIL2zl5DhJ9uEzA5NW3wRCXd7gqexbDn3pIFxtd-L7O60bldf_OP3f715Gk.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6638e4dae6496be06435aa4a_USIOcl8g4dlkCPV6D8c01F8oPwOFs7dTw7J9vsBPUjIgv-DtfOds8DBpq3k-8qN9Z947jqi-yhP3R3VHI0TKYp7_0KbNgIL2zl5DhJ9uEzA5NW3wRCXd7gqexbDn3pIFxtd-L7O60bldf_OP3f715Gk.webp)

 73 | 
 74 | ## **Work with your engineers to set up automated alerting workflows**
 75 | 
 76 | Product integrations will, inevitably, break. When they do, your engineers will need to pinpoint the issue quickly so that they can work on resolving it as soon as possible.
 77 | 
 78 | To that end, you can connect the monitoring tool your engineers use to collect logs of API requests and responses (e.g., Datadog) with the platforms these teams tend to check often already, such as Slack and Gmail.
 79 | 
 80 | Once you’ve built the integration, you can build an automation where once a specific alert is detected via an [API log](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-logs), key details from that alert get routed to a predefined email alias and/or channel in your messaging tool.
 81 | 
 82 | [![Issue routing workflow for integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66341baaa131ae5f2daf36ba_4KgkosGoJffHvTNYHQi_HQuigSEasWFVgHnE_AAkQ5Mvolv-BSqMAh2uv9OyFHWB8P4zb4Oiv-e1BZxZvIjFMxxZDCw4b1q0FKQHPHhqMZCfM2QpXZlAZThbUU9pdl4b2EtOQiEDc6X-sGksyPXl0V8.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66341baaa131ae5f2daf36ba_4KgkosGoJffHvTNYHQi_HQuigSEasWFVgHnE_AAkQ5Mvolv-BSqMAh2uv9OyFHWB8P4zb4Oiv-e1BZxZvIjFMxxZDCw4b1q0FKQHPHhqMZCfM2QpXZlAZThbUU9pdl4b2EtOQiEDc6X-sGksyPXl0V8.webp)
 83 | 
 84 | You can take this a step further by [using a large language model (LLM)-powered agent as part of the workflow automation](https://www.merge.dev/blog/llm-powered-agents-intelligent-workflow-automations). More specifically, based on the information provided in the log, the agent can attempt to diagnose the issue and, based on its diagnosis, provide a potential solution. The agent can then include all of this information within the email or chat message, allowing engineering to resolve the issue faster.

 87 | 
 88 | ## **Adopt a go-to-market strategy for every integration while building it**
 89 | 
 90 | To ensure that each of your product integrations generates a meaningful ROI, you’ll need to take a thoughtful approach to raising awareness of them (both with customers and prospects), pricing them, enabling sales to talk about them, etc.
 91 | 
 92 | And while it’s impossible to cover each of each of these areas in depth here, here are some high-level guidelines to keep in mind:
 93 | 
 94 | - **Pricing:** If an integration is critical in improving the customer experience, it’s likely in your best interest to offer it for “free”. The returns from clients that adopt the integration (in the form of higher retention) will likely make up for the costs of building and maintaining it. Otherwise, you can experiment with other pricing models, such as only including integrations in certain plans.
 95 | 
 96 | [![Under.io's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66341baa3727eb21807b4f8d_LPDx0vhhzh6c6WOK-61jXebJMWGyCPecmI6I3DWUZD2Ah4ExNwEpokKfctOrRwOpSXPv3Ty7AgeSpBo4gyfvMAdjPfC3VygIlTZx3WKm1kG2c9bKwWJ_QugRkGJsP1gu6_GvDFU7aRQidJIXSyaNaoM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66341baa3727eb21807b4f8d_LPDx0vhhzh6c6WOK-61jXebJMWGyCPecmI6I3DWUZD2Ah4ExNwEpokKfctOrRwOpSXPv3Ty7AgeSpBo4gyfvMAdjPfC3VygIlTZx3WKm1kG2c9bKwWJ_QugRkGJsP1gu6_GvDFU7aRQidJIXSyaNaoM.webp)
 97 | 
 98 | _Under.io, a digital onboarding platform for financial services companies, only offers integrations on their “Custom plan”_
 99 | 
100 | - **Marketing:** It’s worth announcing key integration launches on your social channels, highlighting integrations on your site through an [integration marketplace](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace), emailing clients and prospects about the integrations, and even including them in case studies when possible.
101 | 
102 | [![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e589d3cd85d73a04289489_Screenshot%202025-03-27%20at%201.24.19%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e589d3cd85d73a04289489_Screenshot%202025-03-27%20at%201.24.19%E2%80%AFPM.png)
103 | 
104 | _ExpenseOnDemand, a leading expense management platform, highlights integration announcements across their site with a banner_
105 | 
106 | - **Sales enablement:** It’s not only critical to help reps understand which integrations are available and which are on the roadmap. You’ll also want them to understand the various use cases they enable, as that can help prospects better understand their value and whether they’re a fit for their business.
107 | 
108 | In addition, if you can provide demo accounts that show certain integrations in action and train the reps on using them, prospects can better visualize how certain integrations work and get excited about adopting them.

111 | 
112 | ## **Leverage a unified API solution**
113 | 
114 | Your product and engineering teams don’t have to manage integrations on their own. In fact, they shouldn’t, as integration development and maintenance likely isn’t one of your engineering team’s core competencies. It also distracts them from working on your product, which can have a significant long-term impact on your business.
115 | 
116 | While you have a few [options for outsourcing integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/outsourcing-integration), your best option is a [universal API solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/universal-api)(otherwise known as a unified API solution).
117 | 
118 | Using this type of solution, you can build to a single, aggregated API and then access hundreds of customer-facing integrations. This makes the process of scaling integrations significantly easier and faster.

132 | ## **Product manager integrations FAQ**
133 | 
134 | In case you have any more questions, we’ve addressed several more common ones below.
135 | 
136 | ### **What does a product manager (PM) for integrations do?**
137 | 
138 | Among other tasks, a product manager for integrations usually decides which integrations get prioritized, scope out the requirements for building each, and ensure that go-to-market teams are enabled to sell, support, and market each integration successfully.
139 | 
140 | ### **What are some common interview questions for a PM for integrations role?**
141 | 
142 | Here are a few to keep in mind and prepare for:
143 | 
144 | - What does your process of prioritizing product integrations look like?
145 | - How do you measure the success of a product integration?
146 | - How do you forecast the potential benefits of a product integration?
147 | - Do you have experience working with 3rd-party integration tools, like a unified API or an embedded iPaaS solution?
148 | - How do you decide which engineers should work on specific facets of an integration project?
149 | 
150 | ### **How do you decide between building integrations in-house and outsourcing them to a 3rd-party?**
151 | 
152 | ‍
153 | 
154 | The decision depends on several factors, and you’ll need to review each carefully.
155 | 
156 | - **How important is the integration to your business?** If it’s core to using your product, it may not be worth outsourcing. The 3rd-party may not resolve issues as quickly as you’d like and/or enhance the integration as much as you and your customers/prospects want over time
157 | 
158 | - **Do you have engineering capacity to not only build but also maintain the integration throughout its lifespan?** Product integrations typically require hundreds of engineering hours every year, which may not be feasible for your business and/or desirable, as it prevents your engineers from building out and improving your core product
159 | 
160 | - **How customized does the integration need to be?** If it has to be highly customized, it may be difficult to outsource. That said, 3rd-party integration solutions—like Merge—now offer features to help you customize each integration
161 | 
162 | Here’s a decision tree that can help you decide whether to outsource a given product integration:
163 |

165 | 
166 | ### **How does adding product integrations differ from building other product features?**
167 | 
168 | Unlike other product features, product integrations require working with a 3rd-party provider’s API. This introduces risk, as your team can’t fully control the 3rd-party API provider’s performance and improvements over time.
169 | 
170 | Moreover, the timeline of building a product integration largely depends on the 3rd-party API provider. For instance, they may require you to enter into a formal partnership agreement to access their sandbox environment and documentation, which can take months.
171 | 
172 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 54 | Product objectives help you keep your team accountable, prioritize your team’s projects effectively, and identify when and how you need to pivot.
 55 | 
 56 | To help you set any product objective successfully, we’ll review best practices for crafting them and highlight the objectives that several leading software companies use.
 57 | 
 58 | But first, let’s align on the definition of a product objective as well as why they’re important.
 59 | 
 60 | ## **What is a product objective?**
 61 | 
 62 | It’s a qualitative or quantitative goal that your team sets for your product. The goal can include product-specific or business outcomes and it can apply to your product as a whole or to a specific area (e.g., a new feature).
 63 | 
 64 | [![Overview on product objectives](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67ccb5f33fa8dc75714201f9_Product%20objective%20overview%20(2).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67ccb5f33fa8dc75714201f9_Product%20objective%20overview%20(2).png)
 65 | 
 66 | _Related:_ [_What is a product experience strategy?_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-experience-strategy)
 67 | 
 68 | ## **Benefits of product objectives**
 69 | 
 70 | Here’s why your product initiatives should have objectives attached to them:
 71 | 
 72 | - **Optimizes developer resources:** Your developers have limited bandwidth and need to be allocated towards the most impactful projects. Product objectives can help by revealing the projects that can deliver the highest return for the business
 73 | 
 74 | - **Provides the foundation for planning:** By understanding the north star product goal, your team can begin crafting concrete activities and timelines for reaching it
 75 | 
 76 | - **Enables easy tracking:** Your team can consistently track the progress towards the objective and, based on how things are going, either pivot or double down
 77 | 
 78 | - **Drives cross-functional alignment:** By helping all the relevant teams understand what the end goal is, they can work together effectively to reach it
 79 | 
 80 | - ‍ **Empowers you to stay focused on certain projects:** As you receive product asks, your team can more easily say no or deprioritize them based on the current objectives you’re trying to achieve
 81 | 
 82 | ## **Examples of product objectives**
 83 | 
 84 | To better understand how your product objectives can look, let’s review a few that leaders at widely-known companies have adopted.
 85 | 
 86 | ### **Linear enforces a zero-bugs policy**
 87 | 
 88 | Linear, a modern tool for product management, doesn’t want a single bug to linger in their product. At the same time, they don’t want their engineers to consistently get pulled from their core projects to resolve bugs.
 89 | 
 90 | This led their team to set a “zero-bugs policy” for their product and enforce the policy in a way that prevents context switching for their engineers at large.
 91 | 
 92 | More specifically, they assign a weekly “goalie” who’s tasked with fixing the bugs that get triaged throughout that week.
 93 | 
 94 | Here’s more from Cristina Cordova, the COO at Linear:

147 | ### **Drata has several objectives to improve their UX**
148 | 
149 | Drata, a compliance automation platform that helps companies become audit ready, quickly, has defined several objectives.
150 | 
151 | Here are few according to Jason Hatchett, a Senior PM at Drata:
152 | 
153 | - **Offer invaluable product integrations:** To help them continually refine their integration offerings, their team tracks how quickly and how many customers adopt a given [product integration](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations). At the same time, they track how many customers disconnect a certain integration and the speed at which they do so
154 | 
155 | - **Automate as much as possible in the platform:** This helps users spend little time looking for information and realize a fast time to value
156 | 
157 | - **Provide highly-accessible content on using their platform:** They strive to make the content around using their platform—either via their trust center or self-help guides—easy to follow, even if the reader doesn’t have first-hand experience with their platform
158 | 
159 | That said, they also take a more holistic approach to measuring product success by tying it to their company’s ultimate goal.
160 | 
161 | According to Jason:
162 | 
163 | _“Drata’s goal is to help companies become audit-ready ASAP._ So, we try to track how our efforts accelerate audit-readiness. This involves interviewing customers and seeing which tasks are the most time-intensive and viewing product usage metrics on how long it takes customers to get all audit evidence into a ‘Ready’ state.”

173 | ### **Gong wants sellers to love their platform**
174 | 
175 | From day 1, Gong, the leading revenue intelligence platform, established and continues to prioritize a holistic and qualitative product objective: Make their platform irresistible to sellers.
176 | 
177 | This objective influences critical product decisions, such as the features they decide to prioritize as well as personnel decisions, such as the post sales teams they decide to staff.
178 | 
179 | Gong’s CPO and co-founder, Eilon Reshef, shares more on how they landed on this product objective since Gong's inception:

230 | ## **How to set product objectives successfully**
231 | 
232 | Here are some best practices to help you establish effective product objectives.
233 | 
234 | ### **Use the SMART framework**
235 | 
236 | Using the SMART framework (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound), you can better define your goals, prioritize them, and measure and track them.
237 | 
238 | For example, say you’re launching a suite of integrations to your product. Using SMART, your product objective can be something like “Get 25% of our enterprise customers to adopt one of our new product integrations within 3 months.”
239 | 
240 | This is specific, as it references customer adoption for new product integrations; it’s measurable, as you’re aiming to get 25% adoption from enterprise customers; it’s achievable (assuming you’ve seen similar adoption from previous integrations); and it’s time-bound, as the goal is to do this within 3 months.

244 | ### **Leverage customer and prospect data to inform your objectives**
245 | 
246 | Your team can pull together reports on not only the top product requests and issues but also the customers and prospects that are making these requests and/or are affected by them.
247 | 
248 | You can then pull the annual recurring revenue associated with these customers and open opportunities to better understand whether it’s worth converting specific product feedback into an objective.
249 | 
250 | [![How to establish revenue risk or opportunity for your product](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67c10c600a6fad461371996a_ARR%20assigned%20to%20product%20initiative%20(4).webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67c10c600a6fad461371996a_ARR%20assigned%20to%20product%20initiative%20(4).webp)
251 | 
252 | _Assuming the feedback above has a relatively critical impact on ARR, you can create a product objective that centers around adding these product integrations_
253 | 
254 | ### **Get input from go-to-market teams**
255 | 
256 | While executives may be the only ones who need to sign off on your product objectives, go-to-market teams, like customer success and sales, can weigh in on the product objectives that will have the biggest impact on the business—at least from their perspective.
257 | 
258 | To get their feedback, you can survey them on your objectives, present it to them during a meeting and ask for live feedback, poll them on the objectives they think are are most relevant via a platform like Slack, etc.
259 | 
260 | ### **Embrace flexible product objectives**
261 | 
262 | Even after you’ve set your product objectives, shifting market trends or new customer insights should push you to replace the existing objectives, modify them, or focus on other existing ones.
263 | 
264 | Jason Hatchett and his team at Drata have fully embraced this approach:
265 | 
266 | “We’re extremely flexible and responsive to any insights we glean mid-sprint or project. _We’re not afraid of pivoting,_ assuming the dev team can accommodate the changes and the projected final outcome is firmly based on customer feedback and research.”
267 | 
268 | ‍‍‍‍
269 | 
270 | ### **Revisit your product objectives frequently**
271 | 
272 | The rate at which your market evolves and your customers’ and prospects’ needs shift will dictate how often you need to review and potentially adjust your product objectives.
273 | 
274 | For smaller companies in fast-growing markets, this can be as often as every month; while larger companies in more mature markets can review them as infrequently as once per year.
275 | 
276 | ## **Meet your integration objectives with Merge**

288 | ## **Product objectives FAQ**
289 | 
290 | In case you have any more questions on product objectives, we’ve addressed several more frequently-asked questions below:
291 | 
292 | ### **What is the difference between a product objective and a product vision?**
293 | 
294 | A product objective is tied to a certain outcome while a product vision is focused on the  future experience and value your product can provide.
295 | 
296 | ### **What is the difference between a product objective and a business objective?**
297 | 
298 | A product objective can support a business objective, but it can also support non-business goals, such as getting a higher rate of customers to complete a key task in your platform.
299 | 
300 | ### **Which teams are typically involved in setting product objectives?**
301 | 
302 | While it depends on the objective, the product team often collaborates on goals with engineers, leaders in sales, marketing and customer success, and the C-suite.
303 | 
304 | ### **What are some common product objective key performance indicators (KPIs)?**
305 | 
306 | The best KPIs to use will depend on the type of product you offer and the specific areas you want to measure, but here are a few common KPIs:
307 | 
308 | - **Active user growth:** The daily, weekly, and/or monthly active user growth your product experiences
309 | 
310 | - **User expansion:** How much users in a new market (e.g., a target region) adopt your product
311 | 
312 | - **Share of market:** How much market share your product has gained (or lost)
313 | 
314 | - **Product usage:** The extent to which overall product (or feature) adoption has increased or decreased
315 | 
316 | - **Workflow completions:** The rate at which customers complete a key workflow in your product
317 | 
318 | - **Product reliability:** How many tickets get filed for product issues over time
319 | 
320 | - **Time to market:** How quickly your product gets pushed live
321 | 
322 | - **Time spent on a task or workflow:** How quickly users can finish a specific activity or process
323 | 
324 | - **Ease of use:** The extent to which users can use your product independently
325 | 
326 | - ‍ **Customer satisfaction:** How happy (or unhappy) users are with your product (e.g., the NPS® score on your product)
327 | 
328 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 50 | Building software that truly hits the mark starts with solid product planning.
 51 | 
 52 | But what exactly does that mean, especially now when [product managers need to incorporate AI](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy) as much as possible?
 53 | 
 54 | We’ll break down how product planning works in 2025 to ensure you’re able to perform it successfully.
 55 | 
 56 | ## **What is product planning?**
 57 | 
 58 | It’s the process of defining your product's strategy over a certain time horizon and then executing against it.
 59 | 
 60 | For example, you can set a product plan for a given quarter that defines the AI features you want to build, the integrations you want to implement, the security capabilities you want to develop, and more for a specific solution.
 61 | 
 62 | [![Visual of what a product plan is](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6822181e8e8adb5cefadc029_AD_4nXfa7q-kP3xMpQ_pxYfG6nSCTXfCaOLe1Pdsq2VpjJCkJwaChsPt2EOvge85xcd5sDaEgm0-pHLr6-8uf5ZMNrU59ajZ2QLmlq33sGvGyENK4UkJvl1H70LYj1mnZiWngk4EF3crXQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6822181e8e8adb5cefadc029_AD_4nXfa7q-kP3xMpQ_pxYfG6nSCTXfCaOLe1Pdsq2VpjJCkJwaChsPt2EOvge85xcd5sDaEgm0-pHLr6-8uf5ZMNrU59ajZ2QLmlq33sGvGyENK4UkJvl1H70LYj1mnZiWngk4EF3crXQ.png)

 69 | 
 70 | ## **Key components of product planning**
 71 | 
 72 | Strong product planning requires you to take the following measures successfully.
 73 | 
 74 | [![What goes into a product plan](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6822181ef9f1bfbee0232c13_AD_4nXdYMY6Sahl4t5a_TyNhtfgU3oQVwJK_SLStki2Wxqrw4-Yh-7mSfsLERz9yT-UjG8uzzhmEXLBmGFCkmJyUinNJHma7hwVS7bw9OVck1TjnrLnumgRUz_KDeaskbZKeg2AoKlWQzw.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6822181ef9f1bfbee0232c13_AD_4nXdYMY6Sahl4t5a_TyNhtfgU3oQVwJK_SLStki2Wxqrw4-Yh-7mSfsLERz9yT-UjG8uzzhmEXLBmGFCkmJyUinNJHma7hwVS7bw9OVck1TjnrLnumgRUz_KDeaskbZKeg2AoKlWQzw.png)
 75 | 
 76 | Let’s take a look at each.
 77 | 
 78 | ### **Market research and analysis: understand your landscape**
 79 | 
 80 | This step involves digging into what your potential and existing customers are doing, what they truly need, where the gaps are in what’s currently available, and testing your own initial ideas before you pour too many resources into them.
 81 | 
 82 | This involves the classic methods:
 83 | 
 84 | - Run market research studies through tools like SurveyMonkey and Qualtrics
 85 | - Host focus groups to gather more in-depth, qualitative feedback
 86 | - Analyze call recordings in tools like Gong to pick up on key, trending topics (these tools now let you easily track the topics that keep coming up in conversations)
 87 | 
 88 | But it's not just about listening to what people _say_; it’s also about watching what they _do_.
 89 | 
 90 | For example, you can use a product analytics tool like Amplitude to pinpoint how users interact with your product—where they get stuck, which features they ignore, etc.—to reveal hidden needs and opportunities. If many users abandon a task at a particular point, that’s a strong indicator that something in that workflow needs significant improvement.
 91 | 
 92 | For example, [Acctual](https://www.acctual.com/), a stablecoin billing and invoicing software, found that users weren’t creating invoices at the rate they expected. By analyzing their user behavior, they ended up discovering that users didn’t know they had to create a contact first. They’d then receive error messages when trying to create the invoice and they couldn’t figure out why.
 93 | 
 94 | The team at Acctual was then able to add this to their product plan and heavily prioritized addressing it—see how they did so [here](https://www.merge.dev/blog/customer-centric-fintech-companies#treat-product-usage-behavior-as-the-ultimate-source-of-truth).
 95 | 
 96 | ##### The real magic happens when you can combine these approaches. Knowing that customers ask for a feature is one thing; knowing that _and_ seeing from your data that a high percentage of users churned because you didn’t provide that feature makes the case for building it undeniable.
 97 | 
 98 | _Related:_ [_A guide to the product development lifecycle_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-development-lifecycle)
 99 | 
100 | ### **Product vision and strategy: your guiding light**
101 | 
102 | Based on all the research you perform, you’ll likely have a solid understanding of the direction you need to take your product both in the short and long term.
103 | 
104 | You can use these insights to create a product vision, which explains _why_ your product exists and where it's headed. The product strategy is then your plan to get there—detailing your key initiatives, who you're targeting, and how you'll stand out.
105 | 
106 | For example, if you offer a B2B payments platform, like Ramp or Brex, your product vision can be something like “To simplify and automate the entire accounts payable process for mid-market finance teams.” Your product strategy can then include targeting finance teams at companies with 50–500 employees, launching initiatives like integrating with popular accounting systems for mid-market companies, and more.
107 |

109 | 
110 | ### **Roadmapping**
111 | 
112 | Your product roadmap should be more than just a schedule of features; it should explain _why_ you're building certain things. This gets everyone on the same page and gives you a clear way to decide what to work on.
113 | 
114 | Different [types of product roadmaps](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-roadmap-examples) exist:
115 | 
116 | - **Timeline-based roadmaps:** Show features planned over time. This is useful for coordinating, but it can also create pressure to execute on certain dates—regardless of whether the feature is fully ready

119 | 
120 | _GitHub, a platform that lets developers create, store, manage, and share their code, separates their roadmap items by quarters_
121 | 
122 | - **Theme-based roadmaps (or Goal-oriented roadmaps):** Focus on broader goals or customer problems (like "Improve User Onboarding" or "Enhance Reporting Capabilities") instead of just features. This gives more freedom to find the best solutions
123 | 
124 | - **Outcome-based roadmaps:** Target specific changes in user behavior or business results (e.g., "Increase user engagement by 15%")
125 | 
126 | - **Feature-driven roadmaps:** List the specific features you plan to build, often grouped by release
127 | 
128 | Whatever method you choose, you’ll want to adapt as you learn more from customers either directly or indirectly (i.e., how they use your product).
129 | 
130 | ### **Prioritization frameworks**
131 | 
132 | Once you have a list of potential features, improvements, and ideas, how do you decide what to build first?
133 | 
134 | That’s where prioritization frameworks help. They give you a structured way to weigh your options so you can focus on what will make the biggest impact.
135 | 
136 | Here are a couple of popular ones:
137 | 
138 | #### **MoSCoW**
139 | 
140 | This simple method sorts features into four groups:
141 | 
142 | - **M** ust-have: Your product won't work or be viable without this
143 | - **S** hould-have: Important to have but not critical
144 | - **C** ould-have: Nice-to-haves that improve the experience but aren't essential
145 | - **W** on't-have (this time): Things you’re intentionally not building right now
146 | 
147 | For example, for a new software release, building a user login is a "Must-have," an analytics dashboard might be a "Should-have," a minor UI tweak could be a "Could-have," and a total redesign is a "Won't-have" for this quarter.
148 | 
149 | #### **RICE Scoring**
150 | 
151 | This framework uses numbers to help you compare features:
152 | 
153 | - **R** each: How many people will this affect? (e.g., users per month)
154 | - **I** mpact: How much will it help them or your business? (e.g., a score from 0.25 for minimal to 3 for massive)
155 | - **C** onfidence: How sure are you about your Reach and Impact estimates? (as a percentage)
156 | - **E** ffort: How much work will it take? (e.g., developer-weeks)
157 | 
158 | Once you have numbers, you can calculate your score with the following formula: (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort. A higher scores means it should be a higher priority.
159 | 
160 | For example: Say you’re building a new reporting feature that’d reach 500 customers, have a high impact (score: 2), you're 80% confident, and it takes 4 developer-months.
161 | 
162 | Your score would then be (500 \* 2 \* 0.80) / 4 = 200. You can then compare this score to other potential feature builds/improvements to prioritize what your team works on.
163 | 
164 | There are countless other methods to choose from. Whatever you decide to use, the main goal should be to pick a method and use it consistently so that your decisions are clear and based on your product strategy.
165 | 
166 | ## **Product planning examples**
167 | 
168 | To help you implement product planning processes successfully, let’s take a look at how real-world companies put this into practice.
169 | 
170 | ### **Gong**
171 | 
172 | The revenue AI platform has “Pods” that focus on a specific persona or use case for the platform. Each pod consists of a product manager, a team lead, a developer(s), and a product designer.
173 | 
174 | To help the pods plan new features and enhance existing ones over time, the PM in each will fill out a doc in advance of a recurring quarterly meeting with management. The PMs will outline what their pod plans to build, why they plan to build it (using customer evidence, like snippets of conversations that are recorded and analyzed in Gong), and how they plan to do so.
175 | 
176 | These PMs will go on to present their sections of the doc to management during these quarterly meetings and get live feedback.
177 | 
178 | The PMs will iterate on their plans quickly after the meeting and resend it to management in the hopes of getting their plans fully approved before the start of the coming quarter.

185 | 
186 | ### **CUES**
187 | 
188 | The finserv platform offers a fully-integrated suite of recognition products.
189 | 
190 | Since their company is notably smaller than Gong and their product is less mature, they have a less formal product planning process and it’s baked into their two week sprint cycles.
191 | 
192 | Essentially, their product manager meets with their CTO every 2 weeks to chat about the company’s product priorities. From there, the PM can create tickets for their engineering team. He’ll then have several conversations with engineers to talk through the tasks, get their feedback, align on how they’ll get executed, and potentially uncover other tasks that are even more important.
193 | 
194 | Here’s more from Noah Sclar, a former Senior Product Development Manager at CUES:
195 | 
196 | ##### “The product manager’s calls with engineers are super collaborative. Developer feedback is an essential part of outlining and executing on our product plans.”
197 | 
198 | _Note: As you can tell from our examples, every company approaches product planning differently. Your approach will depend on your team’s and product’s maturity, customers’ and prospects’ needs and wants, competitive pressures, and more._
199 | 
200 | _You also don’t need to adopt all the components we shared for planning your products. But having some structure and process should help your team think deeply about what needs to be built and improved on, when different items need to be executed, and how to prioritize different initiatives when necessary._

 38 | @Merge
 39 | 
 40 | In our latest edition of Product Profiles, we interviewed [Carlos Armas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosarmasreyes/), a Product Director at [TravelPerk](https://www.travelperk.com/)— which provides a corporate travel management platform to companies of all sizes and industries.
 41 | 
 42 | Carlos walked us through a wide range of topics. This includes how his teams are structured, run sprints, use retrospectives to improve, and build product integrations.
 43 | 
 44 | You can read on to learn what Carlos shared!
 45 | 
 46 | ### **Can you walk us through your teams?**
 47 | 
 48 | I, along with an engineering and design lead, manage a multidisciplinary tribe of squads that include engineers, designers, product managers, data analysts, and content specialists.
 49 | 
 50 | The teams own a broad scope of the platform. A few of my teams handle the top-of-funnel acquisition and activation of users who manage their organization’s business travel (i.e. travel coordinations or travel program managers). The rest of the teams oversee what we refer to as travel program management features, which enable admins to control all aspects of their travel program and ensure they maintain compliance with their goals (like cost control or sustainability). This involves helping admins manage users’ data and provide access to the platform, ideally in an automated way.
 51 | 
 52 | ### **Generally speaking, how do your teams manage sprints?**
 53 | 
 54 | We give our teams the autonomy to define how they run execution (typically using an Agile methodology), but we look for some common key activities, like retrospectives or triad meetings.
 55 | 
 56 | Retrospectives allow teams to reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and discuss how they could incorporate these learnings in the next sprint. It also serves as a time for team members to share how they’re feeling about their work and how things are going—which hopefully sparks open and honest conversations around improving the work environment.
 57 | 
 58 | The triad meetings allow squad leads across PM, UX, and engineering to align on priorities and progress and to help their teams work together on meeting collective aims.
 59 | 
 60 | As a tribe, we also have common ceremonies, like a bi-weekly with the leads or a tribe all-hands.
 61 | 
 62 | The bi-weekly with the leads helps us align with all the teams on their execution, upcoming plans, and any blockers for achieving their objectives; while the tribe all-hands helps everyone celebrate accomplishments and keep up with key releases that are geared towards meeting our strategic goals.

 65 | 
 66 | ### **Can you share more about how your teams run retrospectives?**
 67 | 
 68 | Similar to sprints, we allow our teams to manage retrospectives in the ways they think are best.
 69 | 
 70 | That said, we engage in a variety of activities to support our teams. For example, if a team member struggles to run a retrospective, we might send someone with experience in leading them (including myself) to shadow the session. The person who’s shadowing can help the team during the retrospective—the level of support they provide naturally depends on how the retrospective is going—as well as provide actionable feedback afterwards.
 71 | 
 72 | We also provide internal examples of well-run retrospectives in the form of videos and written best practices. These examples include more analytically-driven formats, like [“Start, Stop, Continue” retrospectives](https://www.betterup.com/blog/start-stop-continue) that aim to increase team velocity and more emotionally-focused ones geared towards assessing how a team feels with one another and in general. In the case of the latter, the goal is more to open up lines of communication and try to establish a bit of rapport and goodwill.
 73 | 
 74 | The goal of providing all of this support is to help teams know what their options are. From there, they can run the specific retrospective format that best fits their needs following a sprint.
 75 | 
 76 | I also task my PMs with running quarterly retrospectives where they reflect on their top learnings from the quarter, share how they performed relative to their OKRs, and walk through their plans for the upcoming quarter. I’ve found that most of their learnings end up coming from their bi-weekly retrospectives and the bigger retrospective they hold at the end of the quarter with their teams.
 77 | 
 78 | ### **Can you walk me through why integrations are important to TravelPerk?**
 79 | 
 80 | When I joined several years ago, it was obvious that we needed to have integrations with HRIS solutions.
 81 | 
 82 | Without them, our team would have to help clients manually provision and deprovision users. And when you consider that several of our clients’ employees would leave or join in a given week, this task becomes quite burdensome for our clients and our team—especially for clients that operate in industries with naturally high turnover.
 83 | 
 84 | HRIS integrations could streamline the work of provisioning and deprovisioning users at scale and, therefore, improve the customer experience.
 85 | 
 86 | But we also saw additional benefits from integrations. They help us better address prospects’ needs, which allows us to win more opportunities. And they allow us to form new partnerships (with the vendors we integrate with). Through the partnerships, we can engage in co-marketing and co-selling activities with overlapping prospects.
 87 | 
 88 | ### **How did you implement integrations initially?**
 89 | 
 90 | There are so many integration opportunities for our product, so we had to carefully assess the HRIS applications our clients use to prioritize our efforts and ensure that we’d receive a high enough return to justify the investment.
 91 | 
 92 | We identified BambooHR as the most commonly-used HRIS solution, so we started by building a dedicated integration with the HRIS tool.
 93 | 
 94 | We then built a set of APIs following the SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) standard. And while this helped customers that were using an IDP, it was a complicated path for many clients—and that’s why we ended up switching over to Merge!
 95 | 
 96 | ### **How do you build and manage integrations today?**
 97 | 
 98 | We currently use Merge to build [HRIS integrations](https://www.merge.dev/categories/hr-payroll-api), and, using the unified API platform, we’ve launched 6 to date (we’re set to release several more in the near future).
 99 | 
100 | The experience with Merge has been amazing. Instead of having to build and maintain each HRIS integration in-house, we can simply connect to Merge’s Unified API and access all of the integrations we need.
101 | 
102 | In addition, I’ve been really impressed with Merge’s [Integration Management features](https://www.merge.dev/features/integrations-management); having a single place where we can review logs, permission issues, and just monitor each integration has been massively helpful. It’s also something that I think most integration tools don’t prioritize—they’re typically solely focused on simplifying the development side of integrations.
103 | 
104 | While our integrations with Merge are relatively new, we’ve already seen them deliver significant benefits to clients and our business. For instance, when clients use our HRIS integrations, they’re able to implement and roll out TravelPerk to their workforce 50% faster; these clients are also more engaged with the platform and have a higher lifetime value.

108 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 41 | 
 42 | Welcome to another edition of “Product Profiles”, where product leaders share everything from how their teams are structured to how they release new features.
 43 | 
 44 | In this edition, we have the privilege of shining the spotlight on [Jason Hatchett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonhatchett/), a Senior Product Manager at Drata, which offers a top-ranking compliance automation platform.
 45 | 
 46 | You can read on to learn more about Jason and the product team at Drata!

 49 | 
 50 | ### **Can you walk us through how your product team is structured?**
 51 | 
 52 | We’ve divided our product org into three distinct areas of focus.
 53 | 
 54 | - **Democratization:** The PMs are focused on making sure that non-customers can easily absorb and make sense of our content, such as our trust center or self-help guides.
 55 | 
 56 | - **Risk and compliance:** The PMs are tasked with ideating new modules that can help users gather evidence, establish compliance frameworks, among other tasks.
 57 | 
 58 | - **Effortless (my group):** We’re focused on providing an effortless experience to users. Each PM within the group has their own focus area, but our overarching goal is to determine ways to leverage automation as effectively as possible. This involves helping users access information within the product, building connections with 3rd-party applications, and syncing data across different features in Drata.
 59 | 
 60 | ### **What are some of the benefits of having your team structured by different areas of focus?**
 61 | 
 62 | One of the big benefits is that there’s complete transparency on who should perform specific types of work. For instance, if someone is kicking off a big project and they need to designate a feature owner(s) from a product and technical level, they know who to include from the get-go.
 63 | 
 64 | This structure also allows each of us to cultivate deep expertise in specific areas. We can then use this expertise to offer unique, thoughtful perspectives to projects both within and outside of our designated groups. This ultimately translates to positive outcomes over time, whether that’s avoiding potential pitfalls or identifying value-add ideas.
 65 | 
 66 | ### **What are some things that make Drata’s product team best-in-class?**
 67 | 
 68 | Something that comes top of mind for me is that we consistently perform retrospectives post sprints.
 69 | 
 70 | While retrospectives help us in a number of ways, the biggest benefit they’ve brought is allowing us to identify specific stakeholders who can help us, the capacity in which they can help us, and understand when it makes sense to loop them in. This enables continuous improvement on our features and on how the entire team operates to achieve our goals.
 71 | 
 72 | We’re also extremely flexible and responsive to any insights we glean mid-sprint or project. We’re not afraid of pivoting, assuming the dev team can accommodate the changes and the projected final outcome is firmly based on customer feedback and research.
 73 | 
 74 | _Related:_ [_A deep dive on how TravelPerk's product team runs sprints and manages retrospectives_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-profiles-carlos-armas)
 75 | 
 76 | ### **How do you measure the ROI of your work?**
 77 | 
 78 | It obviously depends on the area of focus. For my group, we pay close attention to integration adoption; how support tickets are trending; the velocity and volume of customers that are adopting specific product features and how that translates to bottom-line metrics; and how quickly customers move away from specific features (e.g. how quickly clients disconnect an integration).
 79 | 
 80 | That said, Drata’s overarching goal is to help companies become audit-ready as quickly as possible. So, if possible, we try to track the extent to which our efforts accelerate audit-readiness. We can try to track this by interviewing customers and seeing which tasks are the most time-intensive, and by viewing product usage metrics around how long it takes customers, on average, to get all audit evidence into a ‘Ready’ state.
 81 | 
 82 | ### **How does your team approach integrations?**
 83 | 
 84 | I may be slightly biased here, but integrations are absolutely core to Drata’s platform. The data needed to audit a system will always be sourced from different vendors, whether it’s a core infrastructure platform like AWS or an MDM platform like Jamf. Having one system reach out and gather all of this information for someone can save hours of manual effort.
 85 | 
 86 | To help our users realize the full potential of Drata, we offer several categories of integrations, including cloud identity providers, background check providers, HRIS solutions, and ticketing applications.
 87 | 
 88 | We’ve decided that we’d like to keep some integration categories in-house for now, such as observability and background check solutions. But for other categories, like HRIS and ticketing, we’ve decided to partner with Merge.
 89 | 
 90 | Merge’s Unified API approach makes scaling integrations incredibly easy. Once we’ve connected to one of Merge’s Unified APIs, adding another integration within that unified API's category simply involves a few low-lift changes on our front-end and activating it in the Merge dashboard. In other words, after we build to Merge's Unified APIs, there’s basically zero development work involved!
 91 | 
 92 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 39 | 
 40 | Welcome to our new content series, “Product Profiles”.
 41 | 
 42 | Every few weeks, we’ll interview a product leader to learn how their organization runs product management, from planning their product roadmap to managing their sprints to collaborating with other teams.
 43 | 
 44 | To kick things off, we chatted with [Noah Sclar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-sclar-333582159/), a Senior Product Development Manager at [CUES](https://www.getcues.com/), which offers a fully-integrated suite of recognition products.
 45 | 
 46 | Noah talked to us about his day-to-day work, how he’s leveled-up as a PM, why they run sprints on a two-week cadence, how they approach product integrations, and more.
 47 | 
 48 | You can read on to see what he shared!

 51 | 
 52 | ### **Can you walk me through how you work with your CTO and engineers?**
 53 | 
 54 | I meet with my CTO on a bi-weekly cadence to talk through our priorities and next steps in taking the company vision and translating it to the product. This can be ideating net-new features we need to build and speccing them out with design, identifying existing features we should update, pinpointing bugs that need to be addressed, and so on.
 55 | 
 56 | Following these conversations, I build out the tickets in Jira and go on to have several meetings with our engineers during the first few days of the sprint. Throughout these meetings, the engineers can tell me if anything is unclear, what else I can provide to support them, and if they have any feedback on my ideas. In some cases, they’ll provide ideas that I didn’t even think were possible, or suggest more efficient solutions to a given problem. All of this to say, these calls are super collaborative, and we see developer feedback as an essential part of executing sprints successfully.
 57 | 
 58 | Once the engineers feel enabled to execute their tasks and go on to work on them, I QA the deliverables from the previous sprint, and by the end of that week I push them to production. So, just to clarify, our sprints are two weeks long, but the improvements and net-new features that come out of them go live by the end of the following week.
 59 | 
 60 | ### **What’s something you’ve done to level-up as a product manager?**
 61 | 
 62 | The last thing I want to be is the messenger, where I’d basically tell engineers that they need to do a certain task because so-and-so stakeholder wants it done.
 63 | 
 64 | I want to come into my conversations with engineers on a somewhat-level playing field and actually add value to the conversations. With that in mind, I’ve taken some coding classes to learn the coding language we use.
 65 | 
 66 | This has allowed me to better understand any issues they run up against, give them feedback on how to execute certain tasks, and feel more confident when confirming that we need certain tasks to get done within the current sprint.
 67 | 
 68 | Just to give you a quick example, API integrations are critical to our product. Before engaging with Merge, it was critical that I understood the technical nuances of API calls and payloads from specific 3rd-party applications. In addition, it was important to understand how the data from these payloads mapped back to our database.
 69 | 
 70 | The coding classes I took not only helped me grasp all of this but also understand specific issues and how to address them, like the prospect of payloads overwhelming our servers.
 71 | 
 72 | ### **How did you land on running two-week sprints?**
 73 | 
 74 | A lot of it has to do with how our product works, and I’d imagine that the answer is similar for PMs at other companies.
 75 | 
 76 | Our product is mobile-dependent, so while our users can send money or messages to colleagues via our web-based application, the beneficiaries would receive and accept the payments or messages via our mobile app.
 77 | 
 78 | We’ve found that iPhones release updates less frequently than Androids (our application is available on both devices), and, given the cadence with the former, we ultimately found that it didn’t make sense to release updates every week. Two weeks was perfect; it ensured that the updates kept pace with our team’s speed of innovation and it lined up well with Apple’s release schedule.
 79 | 
 80 | ### **What KPIs do you care about?**
 81 | 
 82 | It’s hard to gather customer feedback organically. Reason being, while our platform is critical to users, it isn’t necessarily going to inspire 5-star reviews. I like to compare us to Venmo in this scenario: Their users know that the application is invaluable to their day-to-day life, but you’d be hard pressed to find someone who actually feels compelled to write a review on the app.
 83 | 
 84 | With that said, product usage is really my north star. I like to check how much money is moving through our platform as well as how many messages get sent every day and week-over-week. As long as usage per user goes up on average, I’m generally happy.
 85 | 
 86 | Product usage also influences the majority of our feature enhancement decisions. For example, as we gain user data on withdrawals by channel (e.g. Paypal), we’ll follow the user data and allow that to inform our decisions. This can lead to creating quick actions for users to access funds instantly, allowing users to bank rewards for fewer volumes of transactions, among other potential enhancements.
 87 | 
 88 | ### **How have you approached building and maintaining product integrations?**
 89 | 
 90 | We’ve always known that product integrations are extremely important for us.
 91 | 
 92 | And while there are several ways that integrations can benefit our product, the ability to integrate employee rosters successfully across our clients’ HRIS solutions is probably the most important use case. Without a seamless integration, our clients would be forced to manually remove and add employees to our application every day; and considering that our clients naturally experience a lot of employee turnover, this can quickly turn into a nightmare.
 93 | 
 94 | We ended up using Merge to build several HRIS integrations and built daily roster syncs with our product. This has also allowed us to easily and accurately determine the number of active users in an account at a given point in time—enabling us to update our subscriptions with ease.
 95 | 
 96 | Now the proof is in the pudding: The integrations we’ve built with Merge have helped us prevent customer churn and have gone a long way in improving the customer experience.

 99 | 
100 | “It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”

 39 | 
 40 | Welcome to another edition of “Product Profiles”, where product leaders share everything from how their teams are structured to how they release new features.
 41 | 
 42 | We were fortunate enough to chat with [Rahm Fehr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahmfehr/) from [Gong](https://www.gong.io/), a Revenue Intelligence Platform that uses proprietary AI technology to help GTM teams capture every customer interaction, understand it, and act on their learnings quickly and effectively.
 43 | 
 44 | Rahm is currently a Senior Director of Product Management and was the company's first Head of Product. He has a wealth of experience in product management, not only at Gong but also from his time at Verint and Kenshoo.
 45 | 
 46 | You can read on to learn more about Rahm and the product team at Gong!
 47 | 
 48 | ### **Can you tell me a little bit about your background at Gong?**
 49 | 
 50 | I’ve worked at Gong for just over 5 years now and spent the first couple of years leading the product function. Eventually, one of our co-founders (and my manager) decided that he wanted to focus solely on product management, so his role evolved from CTO to Chief Product Officer.
 51 | 
 52 | As our product function scaled, we added several groups under me that focused on key areas of our platform. This includes groups on Conversation Intelligence, Mobile, Data Capture, and Sales Assistance.
 53 | 
 54 | More recently, I’ve taken on an initiative that involves leveraging the Gong in other domains. I can’t say too much about this platform at the moment; suffice to say, it will serve a new audience and address additional pain points for GTM, as well as other teams.
 55 | 
 56 | _Related:_ [_How the product team at TravelPerk operates_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-profiles-carlos-armas)
 57 | 
 58 | ### **How is the product team structured today?**
 59 | 
 60 | We work in pods that focus on a specific persona and/or use case; each pod has a product manager, team lead, developer(s), and a product designer. Several pods share an analyst and a writer.
 61 | 
 62 | A set of related pods makes up a group; each group solves a broader problem or use case, like deal management or sales engagement. The product group managers and other related units report to our CPO.
 63 | 
 64 | Outside of these groups, we have centrally-managed product design and analyst teams to ensure that the designers, writers, and analysts in the pods and groups are aligned. And we have a product operations function that builds out, monitors, and optimizes all of our processes. This includes how we capture and assign requests, approve specific plans, communicate with go-to-market teams, release new features, and so on. Their work ultimately takes a lot of work off of our product managers’ plates, allowing the PMs to focus on core parts of their role.
 65 | 
 66 | ### **Do your pods run sprints?**
 67 | 
 68 | We decided early on that we didn’t want to enforce specific processes for each pod; we felt that they should have the autonomy to work in the way that suits them best.
 69 | 
 70 | Also, to be frank, we don’t really believe in sprints. I’ve found that they force teams into one of two extremes: There’s either not enough to do during the sprint, leading the employees to experience quite a bit of down time; or there’s too much to do, which compromises the quality of execution.
 71 | 
 72 | That said, we do have certain requirements for our pods, mainly in areas that require collaborating with managers or a team outside the pod.
 73 | 
 74 | Each PM from a pod has to fill out a feature brief, which requires them to provide context on what they’re looking to solve, why, and how. In addition, they need to include insight from users that backs what they’re looking to accomplish, which they usually provide via actual snippets of conversation that’s recorded and analyzed in Gong. Once the PM provides all of this, other pod members (along with our leaders and complementary teams, like R&D) can review the briefs and provide their input on it.
 75 | 
 76 | We also have recurring planning meetings every quarter and year. Similar to the product brief, each PM from a pod has to provide context in a doc around what they’re looking to solve for the coming quarter (or year), why, and how. The PMs present these docs to management during the meetings, and management can provide approvals or constructive feedback—with the goal of having plans fully-approved before the coming quarter (or year).
 77 | 
 78 | Finally, we have monthly meetings between the group lead (along with the PMs and team leads of each pod and a few heads of specific functions) and the head of product and the head of R&D. They’ll use the time to assess their progress, discuss obstacles, opportunities, etc.
 79 | 
 80 | ### **How does Gong release new features?**
 81 | 
 82 | Gong continuously deploys product updates, but we open new features to customers on a monthly cadence to prevent overwhelming our GTM teams and clients.
 83 | 
 84 | We typically release a feature within Gong first, which gives us a chance to “drink our own champagne” and see if there are any kinks that need to be sorted out. Then, depending on the feature, its potential impact, and what we’re looking to learn, we may release it to a subset of clients. Once the associated PM is fully confident that the feature delivers its intended value, they push it to GA in coordination with our GTM partners, like product marketing and sales.
 85 | 
 86 | ### **How does Gong approach integrations?**
 87 | 
 88 | We didn’t have the best experience with the other unified API solutions we tried in the past, so we decided to build our integrations ourselves or with the help of partners. And at this point, it’s safe to say that we and our partners have built 140+ native integrations. This includes CRM systems, BI solutions, calendar tools, and other categories of software.
 89 | 
 90 | However, my current pod can’t afford to allocate resources to building and maintaining the integrations with our soon-to-be-released platform. We need our team to focus on building out the features and functionality that differentiates our platform and drives unique value to our clients.
 91 | 
 92 | That led us to try Merge roughly a year ago; and given the success we’ve seen so far in setting up the integrations through one of your unified APIs, we’re now looking to expand our usage of your platform; namely, we’re looking into adopting Merge’s [CRM Unified API](https://www.merge.dev/categories/crm-api).

 52 | Building best-in-class products requires juggling short and long-term business needs with existing and planned resources effectively.
 53 | 
 54 | This juggling exercise can be incredibly complex when you’re dealing with several stakeholders, managing multiple product lines, and serving several types of customers. And this only gets exacerbated when you factor in competitive pressures, economic trends, and more.
 55 | 
 56 | To help you navigate this as effectively as possible, you can build a flexible, comprehensive product roadmap that your cross-functional teams and customers are aware of and bought into.
 57 | 
 58 | We’ll break down how you can build one by highlighting several noteworthy examples and by sharing tips for building your own.
 59 | 
 60 | But first, let’s align on the definition of a product roadmap.
 61 | 
 62 | ## **What is a product roadmap?**
 63 | 
 64 | It’s a visual summary that outlines the products, features, and functionality you plan to build or improve on in your platform. The roadmap can also be filterable by key themes, such as AI or security, to make it easy to skim and analyze.
 65 | 
 66 | [![A visualization of a product roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6810fd2de5397297d3a37602_product%20roadmap.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6810fd2de5397297d3a37602_product%20roadmap.png)
 67 | 
 68 | A great product roadmap should be accessible for go-to-market and technical teams and be steeped in a strong understanding of the business goals, customer needs, and technical realities (e.g., available engineering resources).

 75 | 
 76 | ## **Real product roadmap examples**
 77 | 
 78 | Here are just a few real-world examples of product roadmaps that are worth taking inspiration from.
 79 | 
 80 | ### **GitHub**
 81 | 
 82 | The developer platform offers a [public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/1) that—unsurprisingly—uses their own platform.
 83 | 
 84 | [![GitHub's public roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8efe9024ab8a69aecdf_AD_4nXcG-y7pz9ECFLg9Lnv2VgzBs8AfIiEMShh515G76xOk3ve-z7mC9W6ZsezNmyZppWlH0h6Q1kjX3O6xBj-X0jQEpCwzyrn-RqilvZ0bImJmeWjwIOYRKGxlEOPm6X-FMF5T1Lg3nA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8efe9024ab8a69aecdf_AD_4nXcG-y7pz9ECFLg9Lnv2VgzBs8AfIiEMShh515G76xOk3ve-z7mC9W6ZsezNmyZppWlH0h6Q1kjX3O6xBj-X0jQEpCwzyrn-RqilvZ0bImJmeWjwIOYRKGxlEOPm6X-FMF5T1Lg3nA.png)
 85 | 
 86 | **Some areas worth highlighting:**
 87 | 
 88 | - Their roadmap items are broken down by product focus areas—”Accelerate with AI”, “Secure at every step”, “Platform for collaboration at scale”—so that you can quickly discover what’s being worked on and the status of a given initiative
 89 | 
 90 | 
 91 | - Each roadmap item includes a brief description on why the item is being worked on (“Value Prop”) and the expected benefits from working on it (“Expected Outcome”) to give you more context on the reasons why it’s important
 92 | 
 93 | [![Screenshot of specific item from GitHub's product roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee91f338ed716dc2cd_AD_4nXc9Y8diemo4PStTeMd4ISouSZg9UUkh2lm6F5qhU8qzgYDgwK4RoHcy7ipYqVimpOAaYgBhoyLtVx8MKuMNOL5vuDBj_8UVgQ-dxDtymQtJ6fsa6J3PAT1qHJdJ65zSi-o68jYTqg.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee91f338ed716dc2cd_AD_4nXc9Y8diemo4PStTeMd4ISouSZg9UUkh2lm6F5qhU8qzgYDgwK4RoHcy7ipYqVimpOAaYgBhoyLtVx8MKuMNOL5vuDBj_8UVgQ-dxDtymQtJ6fsa6J3PAT1qHJdJ65zSi-o68jYTqg.png)
 94 | 
 95 | - Roadmap items are segmented by quarters and certain items are also featured in the “Future” column. This includes initiatives that are still being scoped

101 | _Many roadmap items in the “Future” column have a comment like the above to set expectations with stakeholders_
102 | 
103 | ### **Atlassian**
104 | 
105 | Atlassian, which offers a suite of solutions to help employees manage projects, find information, collaborate with one another, and more, offers a [comprehensive product roadmap across their cloud applications and data center solutions](https://www.atlassian.com/roadmap/cloud).
106 |

110 | 
111 | **Some areas worth highlighting:**
112 | 
113 | - Atlassian promotes a quarterly newsletter that shares what they’ve released, what’s coming up, etc.
114 | 
115 | [![How Atlassian promotes their product newsletter](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ed7d6f5dc4c0ba6c56_AD_4nXdGDywIBU7XbVifigttBcMv2f7cRA2wF5EYn91LDpCG9jrle6rff_eiEn8ulgTFfUrRJCKhuBOd3vHD2A9WCRO8F89nYeR0MRSf3zQ4BlHm-2dN6Hgy24bG21HRBQx48cm5IZMdBw.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ed7d6f5dc4c0ba6c56_AD_4nXdGDywIBU7XbVifigttBcMv2f7cRA2wF5EYn91LDpCG9jrle6rff_eiEn8ulgTFfUrRJCKhuBOd3vHD2A9WCRO8F89nYeR0MRSf3zQ4BlHm-2dN6Hgy24bG21HRBQx48cm5IZMdBw.png)
116 | 
117 | - You can access advanced search functionality to find specific roadmap items quickly, whether that’s by using their search bar, filtering for a certain application (e.g., Jira), or selecting a certain status
118 |

120 | 
121 | Since Atlassian offers so many applications, their “Apps” dropdown can be essential for customers that only use a specific solution
122 | 
123 | - If you click into a specific roadmap item, you can find a link to share it. This lets customers and prospects share the context, timeline, and status of a given initiative

131 | ### **Microsoft 365**
132 | 
133 | Microsoft 365 includes several widely-used productivity applications (e.g., Microsoft Word) and cloud services (e.g., OneDrive) and security features.
134 | 
135 | Like Atlassian, their product roadmap offers advanced search capabilities to help customers and prospects find relevant updates, quickly.

138 | 
139 | **Some areas worth highlighting:**
140 | 
141 | - Each roadmap item includes two types of dates to clarify their level of availability—”Preview Available” and “Rollout Start”
142 | 
143 | [![How Microsoft 3365 clarifies status of a roadmap item](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee2d9fec39e201abf8_AD_4nXeA0AUoG5Eum3iuO62C-jtXL_M5tA4lRs1v_MbxNzY1fMAX3oGITt_QUvFeZQkzBtxTcR-1fxivfFetAniiixaQLPScC2Q0ojQ9-xwX5N1O40XXXo3buDMIcivcpBgDy54gEXiD.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee2d9fec39e201abf8_AD_4nXeA0AUoG5Eum3iuO62C-jtXL_M5tA4lRs1v_MbxNzY1fMAX3oGITt_QUvFeZQkzBtxTcR-1fxivfFetAniiixaQLPScC2Q0ojQ9-xwX5N1O40XXXo3buDMIcivcpBgDy54gEXiD.png)
144 |

194 | 
195 | ## **Types of product roadmaps (and when to use each)**
196 | 
197 | As our examples showed, product roadmaps can use several formats.
198 | 
199 | Here are some of the most common types of roadmaps you’ll want to evaluate.
200 | 
201 | ### **Timeline-based roadmap**
202 | 
203 | This type of roadmap clearly shows when roadmap items are started, worked on, and finished.
204 | 
205 | GitHub’s product roadmap is just one of many examples. (they present timeframes by quarters).
206 | 
207 | [![Screenshot of GitHub's product roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fd4720f1447d44305dda3_Screenshot%202025-04-28%20at%203.17.35%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fd4720f1447d44305dda3_Screenshot%202025-04-28%20at%203.17.35%E2%80%AFPM.png)
208 | 
209 | Time-based roadmaps are popular for good reason: They help cross-functional teams, customers, and prospects quickly understand the timelines for different initiatives, which is one of the main reasons why a product roadmap exists to begin with.
210 | 
211 | This kind of roadmap may not, however, answer high-level questions, like what specific roadmap items aim to accomplish or how a given item fits within the broader product strategy. So if you’re looking to use a product roadmap as a way to drive internal and/or external discussion and buy-in, this may not be the best approach.
212 | 
213 | ### **Now-next-later roadmap**
214 | 
215 | This roadmap format is relatively new and more niche. The way it works is simple: You’d categorize roadmap items into one of three buckets: now, next, or later.
216 | 
217 | For each item, you can also include relevant tags to help people find them faster, the overarching business goals they support, and whether an item is internal and/or external-facing.
218 | 
219 | Here’s an example of how it can look [according to the CEO and co-founder of ProdPad](https://www.prodpad.com/blog/invented-now-next-later-roadmap/):
220 | 
221 | [![Example of now-next-later roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee2b3b4d2652b5678b_AD_4nXd_oM9yOO51PXDDiigMPsKXS4PJwAoV6tnsBsSJkk-SXJjb_m8s9HL6dInbVpjPCsLl3uxB8GLYm2sedSAB-Kf0iaHMj0_jG_vs7fXEKVjmzcxjaJsIUP9QxrVUjXJwBJWQ5zw5.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8ee2b3b4d2652b5678b_AD_4nXd_oM9yOO51PXDDiigMPsKXS4PJwAoV6tnsBsSJkk-SXJjb_m8s9HL6dInbVpjPCsLl3uxB8GLYm2sedSAB-Kf0iaHMj0_jG_vs7fXEKVjmzcxjaJsIUP9QxrVUjXJwBJWQ5zw5.png)
222 | 
223 | One of the benefits of this approach is its simplicity: Readers can immediately tell what’s being worked on and why.
224 | 
225 | But it invites open-ended questions, like “When is a project in ‘Next’ going to be worked on?”, and “What does later mean?” So if you’re looking to provide a roadmap that doesn’t require additional context or follow ups, this may not be the approach to take.

232 | 
233 | ### **Theme-based roadmap**
234 | 
235 | This type of roadmap breaks down roadmap items by themes.
236 | 
237 | Going back to our GitHub example, they adopt a theme-based roadmap by bucketing their roadmap items into the following filterable themes: AI, security, and collaboration.
238 | 
239 | ‍
240 | 
241 | [![Example of theme-based roadmap](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8eef2083fabbfdb4678_AD_4nXcGhIOv9QzaWUpKyXO2etsoaAAO_A6nT-BxJ3rvMGxGF9oarlQRshQsc6ECYUKgd7loGBmlUVvjc3FvryVOxLRgmTkznXI8B9K028NZR_oCMb5aQ9wxqDsa7O37sTPpeu1cIb33ag.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/680fc8eef2083fabbfdb4678_AD_4nXcGhIOv9QzaWUpKyXO2etsoaAAO_A6nT-BxJ3rvMGxGF9oarlQRshQsc6ECYUKgd7loGBmlUVvjc3FvryVOxLRgmTkznXI8B9K028NZR_oCMb5aQ9wxqDsa7O37sTPpeu1cIb33ag.png)
242 | 
243 | This approach lets your readers easily analyze roadmap items within a certain theme. It also provides a high-level understanding of the product’s strategic goals.
244 | 
245 | That said, themes, in and of themselves, aren’t enough. You’ll likely also want to specify when certain roadmap items are being worked on, the specific goals each item supports, etc.
246 | 
247 | ## **Best practices for creating and managing your roadmap**
248 | 
249 | Even if you adopt a proven product roadmap format and follow successful examples, your roadmap might not be effective if you don’t follow the best practices below.
250 | 
251 | ### **Collaborate with engineering early and often**
252 | 
253 | Your engineering team has the insights you need to develop and continually refine your roadmap. This includes:
254 | 
255 | - How long and how many resources certain roadmap items will take to execute
256 | - Whether a given roadmap item is more complex and time-intensive than expected
257 | - If a certain roadmap item has dependencies that require you to add additional items and/or reprioritize your roadmap
258 | 
259 | To stay on top of your engineering team’s experiences and ensure you’re leveraging their expertise consistently, you’ll need to consistently ask for feedback during your recurring sprint syncs, retrospectives, backlog refinement sessions, and other meetings with them.
260 | 
261 | You can make your partnership with engineering even more consistent and structured by setting up a bot in an app like Slack that asks for status updates on specific roadmap items, along with open-ended questions on how things are going to get their candid feedback.
262 | 
263 | ### **Build in flexibility**
264 | 
265 | As the quick and fast rise of large language models (LLMs) showed, innovation can be quick, aggressive, and in many cases, affect your business and/or customers.
266 | 
267 | To help your team be agile and opportunistic when trends—like LLMs—impact your product, you should set the expectation with all of your stakeholders that the product roadmap isn’t fixed but a living, breathing resource that should adapt to your customers’ and prospects’ needs over time.
268 | 
269 | ### **Tie initiatives to strategic goals**
270 | 
271 | Nearly all of our product roadmap examples did a great job of tying initiatives to broader business goals.
272 | 
273 | That isn’t by accident.
274 | 
275 | Most employees and customers who review your roadmap won’t be familiar with individual roadmap items but they'll probably understand your broader product goals. As a result, making this connection helps your colleagues and customers better understand why something is being done and why it is or is not a priority.
276 | 
277 | ### **Surface external dependencies clearly**
278 | 
279 | Many roadmap items require external parties to follow through on a commitment.
280 | 
281 | For example, if you plan to integrate your product with a certain API provider’s endpoint when they plan to make it available, you’re depending on that API provider to actually make it available when they said they would.
282 | 
283 | Whenever you depend on an external party to help execute a roadmap initiative, you should make explicit note of it. That way, if the 3rd-party does fail to deliver on time, your customers and colleagues can easily learn why and won’t be quick to blame you.
284 | 
285 | ### **Review and revise often**
286 | 
287 | As mentioned earlier, your product roadmap can and should evolve alongside your business’ and customers’ needs.
288 | 
289 | To keep your roadmap relevant and effective, you should review it on a cadence that lets you make timely adjustments. For larger companies in relatviely stable markets, this can be once per quarter; while smaller companies in faster-changing markets may want to revisit it as often as every month.

302 | 
303 | Merge also lets you avoid maintaining any of the integrations afterwards and provides integration observability features to help your customer-facing teams manage integrations themselves.
304 | 
305 | ##### Taken together, your engineers can avoid any integration-specific roadmap initiatives and reallocate those time savings to other core initiatives in your roadmap.

 41 | 
 42 | Our team is constantly releasing new security features, additional integrations, enhanced syncing capabilities, and more to help customers add reliable, flexible, and secure integrations to their products.
 43 | 
 44 | We highlighted several of these releases during our inaugural webinar, “ [The Product Update](https://www.merge.dev/webinars/the-product-update-with-merge-fall-2024).”
 45 | 
 46 | Here’s just a snapshot of some of the features we covered and that we hope you can leverage.
 47 | 
 48 | ### **Onboard customers around the world to Merge’s integrations with Link Localization**
 49 | 
 50 | Many of our customers work with organizations in different regions. As a result, they’d need to offer [Merge Link](https://docs.merge.dev/get-started/link/)—a UI component that lets users authenticate and authorize their integrations—in different languages.
 51 | 
 52 | To meet this need, we’ve built Link Localization, which can automatically translate the Merge Link interface to another language for a specific customer(s).
 53 | 
 54 | Link Localization is already available in German, but we’re set to release it in French and Spanish within weeks, and we’ll add additional languages over the coming months.
 55 | 
 56 | [![Merge Link visualizations for English, German, and French](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459b8d336d77d5236a3a_AD_4nXfIstF289x8rJJIVgS2FhhvY6QoJ3k6rkG9GaIN1u3LvMwMYyWKwPms_gBw-5dVPNaNFi-H4m8YRpBJyTYxV54-3YL7l-UNedaaNsirQODZDSXHI2oKmB0Aac3_kVqwT2wKvf8RNDPS_kfQ4Nv-yhDelRKA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459b8d336d77d5236a3a_AD_4nXfIstF289x8rJJIVgS2FhhvY6QoJ3k6rkG9GaIN1u3LvMwMYyWKwPms_gBw-5dVPNaNFi-H4m8YRpBJyTYxV54-3YL7l-UNedaaNsirQODZDSXHI2oKmB0Aac3_kVqwT2wKvf8RNDPS_kfQ4Nv-yhDelRKA.webp)

 61 | 
 62 | ### **Offer a best-in-class FP&A solution with our general ledger endpoint**
 63 | 
 64 | To support customers in the financial planning and analysis (FP&A) space, we’re adding a general ledger endpoint to accounting integrations.
 65 | 
 66 | This will allow our customers to access all the transactions that affect their clients’ general ledgers. In turn, our FP&A customers can power up-to-date, personalized, and actionable forecasts as well as help users plan for a wide range of scenarios effectively.
 67 | 
 68 | [![GL endpoint visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459be9a2a3a55e2d2af0_AD_4nXcHxah35KjRAZEbrRSFdjAe_8Jk6RXW6w7UDBAixYJKI76e7v_wZGpLdiU2UWOlYrrOdDW5beUPCDABwnaOPRQvxc8dpHAsHwTwMGGyFEHaS5Zj3Ow2mMuLpk1Mq8JheH9kEoxSkegpJ8vKBbILgonXoic2.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459be9a2a3a55e2d2af0_AD_4nXcHxah35KjRAZEbrRSFdjAe_8Jk6RXW6w7UDBAixYJKI76e7v_wZGpLdiU2UWOlYrrOdDW5beUPCDABwnaOPRQvxc8dpHAsHwTwMGGyFEHaS5Zj3Ow2mMuLpk1Mq8JheH9kEoxSkegpJ8vKBbILgonXoic2.webp)
 69 | 
 70 | The endpoint is slated to go live for several accounting integrations soon, including Xero, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Online, and NetSuite.
 71 | 
 72 | If you’re an existing customer, you can learn more about it by connecting with your dedicated CSM; otherwise, you can [schedule a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fproduct-update-fall).
 73 | 
 74 | ### **Deliver a seamless onboarding experience by personalizing Merge Link**
 75 | 
 76 | As your customers add integrations via Merge Link, you’ll likely want the experience to feel like a natural extension of your platform.
 77 | 
 78 | With this in mind, we’ve added several features that let you customize Merge Link.
 79 | 
 80 | You can, for example, pick and choose Merge Link’s font type and colors to match your brand’s look and feel.
 81 | 
 82 | [![How to customize Merge Link in our Dashboard](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459ace37ee43f226ac45_AD_4nXe_YG97E-8Db7gf6GfeL99PQCrcok2zJ3Z22_Gku_mBPoII5LpwIRLbYiRjAvCgIm_iRROSyvvL1Cqv7IZy_1a8DM7QWmihZ8apeHlGMRZj5k9kRFv7JGeOzEizg5-UK2t3lk-2WQmAKleg6g64kLLHPu8O.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459ace37ee43f226ac45_AD_4nXe_YG97E-8Db7gf6GfeL99PQCrcok2zJ3Z22_Gku_mBPoII5LpwIRLbYiRjAvCgIm_iRROSyvvL1Cqv7IZy_1a8DM7QWmihZ8apeHlGMRZj5k9kRFv7JGeOzEizg5-UK2t3lk-2WQmAKleg6g64kLLHPu8O.webp)
 83 | 
 84 | You can also white label any of the user guides we’ve built in our help center and that we link out to from Merge Link. This includes adding your logo to the top of these pages and using your own subdomain.

 93 | 
 94 | Our team broke down additional product features and capabilities we’ve added and plan to add during the webinar; and a few customers even shared how they’re using several of our recently-released features to enhance their product integrations.

 462 | ## Announcing our Merge Model Context Protocol (MCP)!
 463 | 
 464 | MCP is quickly becoming the go-to standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) to external data sources. This is why we’re so excited to announce Merge MCP!
 465 | 
 466 | Merge Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows your AI assistant to quickly and intelligently take real actions in your customers’ third-party platforms — whether that’s updating tickets, reading files, or creating journal entries.
 467 | 
 468 | Through just a few lines of code, Merge MCP enables your AI Agent to access hundreds of tools (actions) via a single MCP server.
 469 | 
 470 | Check out our [docs](https://docs.merge.dev/basics/mcp/) and our [GitHub](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-mcp) on how to implement Merge MCP!

1325 | ## New ticketing Common Model: Roles
1326 | 
1327 | We’re excited to announce support for pulling user roles across 24 ticketing integrations! You can now easily access a user’s role — including their role name, actions, and access permissions within the ticketing system — all through the [Roles Common Model](https://docs.merge.dev/ticketing/roles/).
1328 | 
1329 | This ensures that companies building AI search features that need ticketing data can restrict search results to users with the appropriate permissions. Additionally, the addition of Roles more comprehensively supports user access review use cases needed by security and compliance management companies.

1399 | ## Merge supports idempotency for accounting integrations
1400 | 
1401 | With idempotency, Merge allows you to safely retry POST requests without creating duplicate records. This allows for more resilient, scalable integrations, minimizing duplicate requests and supporting asynchronous processing for heavier tasks.
1402 | 
1403 | How it works:
1404 | 
1405 | - Use an idempotency key with each POST request
1406 | - If the same key is reused within 24 hours, no new request is processed — instead, the original response is returned instantly
1407 | 
1408 | You can learn more [here](https://docs.merge.dev/basics/idempotency/). This feature currently is in beta so please reach out to your account representative or [contact us](mailto: support@merge.dev) for more information.

1936 | We now surface SFTP-specific errors directly in our dashboard (under [Issues](https://app.merge.dev/issues?status=ONGOING&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--evBVwbVGnuFOwF7ABYcY_UIONHH2qiULHGIY5BTl3uwzQyG2YIFJ0y9MoJEkiXUssf4Fw)). This provides you guidance on what the exact issue is when an SFTP does not successfully upload, making it easier to troubleshoot. The 4 types of errors that are surfaced are:
1937 | 
1938 | - Wrong file type
1939 | - Wrong file name
1940 | - Missing required fields
1941 | - Incorrectly formatted rows

2070 | ## Shell data filtering
2071 | 
2072 | Merge now automatically detects and hides newly created shell data records, ensuring incomplete data doesn’t appear anymore.
2073 | 
2074 | Shell data records are objects where most fields are null except metadata (e.g., IDs and timestamps). Shell data can be temporarily created due to the ordering of model syncs.
2075 | 
2076 | If you do need shell data records, be sure to include the query parameter `include_shell_data=True` when requesting data.
2077 | 
2078 | Shell object references will still be returned on any related non-shell objects, even without including the `include_shell_data=true parameter` (e.g., the UUID for a shell Location object will still display on a corresponding non-shell Employee object).
2079 | 
2080 | You can learn more [here](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/9713879-what-is-shell-data-filtering)! If you have any further questions, please reach out to your CSM or [support@merge.dev](mailto:support@merge.dev).

3006 |

3018 | 
3019 | For admin-required HR & ATS integrations, an initial screen will now appear in Merge Link to inform your users they must be an admin of that third-party platform to successfully link. There is also a Magic Link URL that your user can share with the relevant admin, improving the overall user experience auth process!

3023 | ## New Field Mapping capabilities
3024 | 
3025 | [Field Mapping](https://docs.merge.dev/supplemental-data/field-mappings/overview/) is a flagship feature, enabling you and your customers to map custom data to Merge’s Common Models. We’ve expanded it’s functionality, making it even more powerful and intuitive.
3026 | 
3027 | - [**Advanced Mapping**](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/9269164-advanced-field-mapping-with-jmespath): Map any custom fields in a “list” or “object” format is now supported! Use JMESPath queries to access specific values from even the most complicated remote field objects.
3028 | - **Field Coverage:** Easily identify the correct remote field from a customer's account to use when mapping custom fields. Field coverage is a percentage estimate of how often a specific remote field appears for a specific Linked Account. The higher the coverage, the more widely it is used.
3029 | - **Preview Values:** Preview and validate that your Field Mapping is accurate before going live. Plug in any Common Model ID to check its return value in the Merge Dashboard.
3030 | 
3031 | These features are all now available on our Professional and Enterprise plans. Try them out today and let us know if you have any feedback!

3519 | ## Enhancements to Field Mapping by surfacing coverage percentage
3520 | 
3521 | We’re continuing to invest in our Field Mapping feature, and have pushed out new functionality to help you identify the best remote field from a customer’s account to leverage!
3522 | 
3523 | We now show the coverage percentage of each remote field, which is a calculation of how often the specific field is returned with a non-null value across that individual linked account.
3524 | 
3525 | For example, if you’re looking to map a specific field mapping for our Employee Object, we will show the coverage for each remote field available for mapping, and how often it is a non-null value for Employees.
3526 | 
3527 | This enhancement will give you more confidence that you are mapping the correct and most valuable field from a third-party system for a given field mapping!
3528 | 
3529 | Access it through the Linked Accounts view in our Dashboard, under the Field Mappings tab.

5557 | ## Migrating to our Advanced SDKs
5558 | 
5559 | We’re so excited to be releasing our Advanced SDKs for [Python](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-python-client/), [Java](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-java-client/), [Node](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-node-client/), and [Go](https://github.com/merge-api/merge-go-client/) to speed up your backend integration with Merge!
5560 | 
5561 | We encourage you to start migrating to our Advanced SDKs for faster turnaround times on any issue, improved developer interface for request/response classes, access to our latest categories, and a more comprehensive test suite.
5562 | 
5563 | The legacy versions (complete category and single category versions) of our Python, Node, Java, and Go SDKs will continue to work but _after February 2024_, we’ll no longer make updates or bug fixes to the deprecated SDKs.
5564 | 
5565 | Please check out our [Help Center](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/7992820-using-merge-sdks) and [docs](https://docs.merge.dev/sdk/) to learn more and get started with comprehensive migration guides.

5616 | ## Async Passthrough is available in open beta
5617 | 
5618 | [Async passthrough](https://docs.merge.dev/supplemental-data/passthrough/async-passthrough/) allows you to retrieve the response at a later time. We built this feature since third-party response times differ and can cause delays for when calling passthrough requests.
5619 | 
5620 | With async passthrough you won't have to wait for a response before calling other requests or endpoints! We’ll also notify you through a webhook when your response is ready.
5621 |

5983 | ## Announcing Integrations Management
5984 | 
5985 | The [Merge Dashboard](https://app.merge.dev/) has gone through major enhancements to provide full visibility and control into each of your linked accounts.
5986 | 
5987 | Maintaining integrations is much more time consuming than the initial build, which is why we're excited about announcing our comprehensive suite of tools: Integrations Management.
5988 | 
5989 | Enhancements that we've made in the Merge Dashboard include:
5990 | 
5991 | - Viewing an accurate, live status of your customers' integration data syncs
5992 | - Searching comprehensive logs for visibility into every single API request at the linked account level
5993 | - Getting proactive alerts of any customer set-up issues such as outdated API keys, both in the dashboard and via API
5994 | - Controlling and customizing what data is shared, respecting your customers’ privacy
5995 | 
5996 | We have more improvements coming soon so keep an eye out! If you're interested in learning how to better use the Merge Dashboard to mange your integrations, [sign up for our webinar](https://www.linkedin.com/events/7078961692390395904/comments/) on July 11,2023 at 10am PT / 1pm ET.

6361 | ## Updates to Linked Account View in the Merge Dashboard
6362 | 
6363 | We are making major enhancements to Merge Dashboard’s [Linked Accounts section](https://app.merge.dev/linked-accounts/accounts) to make our integrations management capabilities even better to help your support teams easily identify and address end user errors. We are excited to rollout the following changes.
6364 | 
6365 | - We’ve added reference docs, API Tester, Help Center, and a Support button, so your support team can access a resource or contact support if there’s an issue with a specific Linked Account.
6366 | - We show a Linked Account’s metadata, data sync status and scope in a single view. This provides visibility in when data was last synced, relevant permission, and current sync status.
6367 | - Added advanced configuration settings, such as field mapping and sync frequencies speeds, highlighting these settings at each linked account level.
6368 |

6370 | 
6371 | There’s a brand new “Data” page so you can view and configure data sync and access settings for a specific Linked Account.
6372 |

6374 | 
6375 | There’s a brand new "Logs" page under each Linked Account so you can access an instant view all API request logs and webhooks related to a specific Linked Account. You don’t need to filter down in the Logs page anymore.

 28 | # Integrations for GDPR-compliant companies
 29 | 
 30 | At Merge, data protection is top priority — and has been from the beginning.
 31 | 
 32 | While the GDPR only governs data protection in the EU, Merge recognizes that the obligations set by the GDPR are the world’s strongest set of data protection directives and as such, Merge chooses to implement these for all data transfers, regardless of geography.

304 | 
305 | Third-party providers require specific (and often different) fields to write data to their APIs, making your code a mess.

180 | How it works
181 | 
182 | ## Infinitely scale your integrations
183 | 
184 | Merge exposes a Unified API with common data models for each category of integrations. Authenticate integrations on behalf of your customers with Merge Link and then access the data synced by the Unified API from a Merge SDK.
185 |

180 | Syncing
181 | 
182 | #### Keep all your data in sync
183 | 
184 | Ensure the freshest data with multiple sync options from third-party APIs to Merge to your backend, including webhooks, periodic polling, and forced resyncs. Plus, you can always POST or PATCH data instantly.

191 | 
192 | Webhooks
193 | 
194 | #### Get notified when the latest data drops
195 | 
196 | Merge generates webhooks whenever updated data is available so you can keep your database up to date with minimal polling. You can also access webhooks emitted directly from third-party API providers.
197 | 
198 | Even better, Merge is able to set up these webhooks right out of the box, where supported. No configuration from you or your end user required.

205 | 
206 | Rate limiting
207 | 
208 | #### Don’t be limited as you scale
209 | 
210 | Merge features a smart rate limiting engine to dynamically handle differences in rate limits and pagination across integrations. You'll never be limited by what data you access.

 50 | Why Merge
 51 | 
 52 | ## From sprint start to finish, Merge helps developers build for scale

 55 | 
 56 | ### One data model for any platform...
 57 | 
 58 | Merge provides a single set of opinionated data models. You interact with these to access your customer’s data from hundreds of SaaS platforms.
 59 | 
 60 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67c04875f53f48dbc6286964_persona-1.svg)
 61 | 
 62 | ### ... with unified everything else...
 63 | 
 64 | From authentication, to pagination, to rate limits, to webhooks and metadata, every piece of your integration is standardized by Merge — regardless of the third-party source
 65 | 
 66 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67c048769dc9061cc7b91369_persona-2.svg)
 67 | 
 68 | ### ... and maintenance?   On us.
 69 | 
 70 | Don’t worry about deprecated API endpoints, unexpected JSON responses, or errant bugs. Merge’s in-house team of integration experts handle all maintenance on your behalf.
 71 |

 83 | 
 84 | ### Searchable logs
 85 | 
 86 | Merge comes with built-in logs that record every inbound and outbound API request. Even better? They’re searchable and filterable.

60 | 
61 | 1. **Tool**. Blueprint, including the software, infrastructure, and technology used to provide it (collectively, the “ **Tool**”) allows users to commence a process by which Merge may begin to create a new integration between its proprietary Software-as-a-Service integration solution for platforms (the “ **Service**”) and a third-party platform, which includes the normalization of the models and fields of the third-party platform (“ **Partner Models**”) to Merge’s standardized models and fields (known as “ **Common Models**”). Following submission of certain required information by a user, including, at the discretion of the user, the user’s email address (the “ **Input**”), the Tool will generate and display a set of preliminary relationships between the Partner Models and the Common Models (the “ **Output**”). The Tool is not part of the Service. Use of the Service is governed by the [Subscriber Agreement](https://merge.dev/legal/subscriber-agreement).
62 | 2. **Beta Feature**. The Tool is a beta feature and is not meant for commercial use. It may contain bugs, faults, errors, and defects and may produce inaccurate results or otherwise not work as intended. Merge may also discontinue providing the Tool or may take the functionality in-house.
63 | 3. **Limited Use License**. Subject to compliance with these Terms and the TOU, Merge grants you a limited, temporary, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, during the Term (as defined below) to use the Tool solely for the purpose of determining preliminary compatibility between the Service and a partner platform. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Merge and its licensors. Nothing in these Terms is intended to grant any rights under any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right of Merge.
64 | 4. **Restrictions**. In addition to the restrictions set forth in the TOU, you may not:
65 | 
66 | (a)
67 | 
68 | use the Tool other than as instructed by Merge;
69 | 
70 | (b)
71 | 
72 | submit any harmful or offensive content, or any content that you do not have the right to submit, via the Tool;
73 | 
74 | (c)
75 | 
76 | modify, create derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to gain access to the source code of, or copy the Tool or any of its components; or use the Tool to develop the same or similar items or directly or indirectly let any third party do so; or
77 | 
78 | (d)
79 | 
80 | circumvent or disable any security or other technological features of the Tool, or use the Tool in a manner that Merge reasonably believes poses a threat to the security of Merge-controlled computer systems.
81 | 
82 | 5. **_Term_** _. As between you and Merge, these Terms will be in effect beginning as of when you (i) click a box indicating acceptance of these Terms or (ii) begin using the Tool, whichever comes first, and will end either (a) when the Tool delivers the Output, or (b) when Merge ceases to make the Tool publicly available, whichever comes first, unless otherwise terminated as provided herein (the “_ **_Term_** _”). Merge may terminate these Terms, and your access to or use of the Tool at any time in its sole discretion. The provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (as applicable) will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms._
83 | 6. **_Feedback_** _. Comments, suggestions and recommendations that you provide to Merge with respect to the Tool or the Output are deemed “_ **_Feedback_** _” as that term is defined and used in the TOU._
84 | 7. **_Disclaimers_** _. The Tool merely conducts a test to determine compatibility between Partner Models and the Common Models and issues a preliminary result. It does not create a complete integration between the Service and a partner platform, and Merge may never build such an integration. Merge will determine whether to complete and release a requested integration in its sole discretion, including timing of such release and the ultimate functioning of the integration. The Output is provided AS-IS and without warranties or any kind. Merge assumes no liability for the Output or any use to which a you might put it._
85 | 8. **_Ownership_** _. As between you and Merge, Merge owns all intellectual property rights in and to the Tool and the Output. You represent and warrant to Merge that you have all rights necessary to submit the Input to Merge. Use of the Input by Merge is governed by these Terms, the TOU, and Merge’s Privacy Policy._
86 | 9. **_Miscellaneous_** _. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and assigns. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the state of California, without reference to conflicts of law rules. This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of these Terms. Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision._

112 | 
113 | 7. Accountings. At Covered Entity’s or HHS’ request, Business Associate or Subcontractor shall make its internal practices, books and records relating to the use and disclosure of PHI available to HHS for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Regulations.

117 | a.
118 | 
119 | _use the PHI for its proper management and administration and to carry out its legal responsibilities;_
120 | 
121 | b.
122 |

134 | 
135 | _use PHI to create de-identified information, and use such de-identified information for its own purposes, provided that the de-identification and use thereof conforms to the requirements of the HIPAA Regulations._
136 | 
137 | 9. Responsibilities of the Business Associate with Subcontractor. If applicable, for the use and/or disclosure of PHI by Subcontractor, Business Associate agrees:
138 | 
139 | a.
140 | 
141 | _To inform Subcontractor of any changes in the notice of privacy practices (“_ **_Notice_** _”) that Business Associate provides, directly or indirectly, to individuals pursuant to the HIPAA Regulations, that affect Subcontractor’s use or disclosure of PHI, and provide to Subcontractor, upon request, a copy of the Notice currently in use._
142 |

154 | 
155 | 10. HIPAA Transaction Standards. If Business Associate or Subcontractor conducts standard transactions (as defined in the HIPAA Regulations) for or on behalf of Covered Entity, Business Associate or Subcontractor will comply and will require by written contract each agent or contractor (including any subcontractor) involved with the conduct of such standard transactions to comply, with each applicable requirement of the HIPAA Regulations. Neither Business Associate nor Subcontractor will enter into, or permit its agents or contractors (including subcontractors) to enter into, any trading partner agreement in connection with the conduct of standard transactions for or on behalf of Covered Entity that: (a) changes the definition, data condition, or use of a data element or segment in a standard transaction; (b) adds any data elements or segments to the maximum defined data set; (c) uses any code or data element that is marked “not used” in the standard transaction’s implementation specification or is not in the standard transaction’s implementation specification; or (d) changes the meaning or intent of the standard transaction’s implementation specification. Business Associate and Subcontractor agree to participate in any test modification conducted by Covered Entity in accordance with the HIPAA Regulations.
156 | 11. Term and Termination. This BAA remains in effect until the Services Agreement is terminated or expires. Either party may terminate this BAA and the Services Agreement effective immediately if it determines that the other party has breached a material provision of this BAA and failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of being notified by the other party of the breach. If the non-breaching party determines that cure is not possible, such party may terminate this BAA and the Services Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to other party.
157 | 12. Limitation of Liability. This BAA is subject to the limitations on liability set forth in the Services Agreement.
158 | 13. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this BAA, Merge agrees to either return or destroy, at no cost to Counterparty, all PHI that Merge maintains in any form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that it is not feasible to return or destroy such PHI, the terms and provisions of this BAA shall survive termination of this BAA, and Merge will only use or disclose such PHI solely for such purpose or purposes which prevented the return or destruction of such PHI.
159 | 14. Miscellaneous. To the extent Business Associate is acting as a business associate under the HIPAA Regulations, Business Associate shall be subject to the penalty provisions specified in HITECH. Upon the effective date of any final regulation or amendment to final regulations promulgated by HHS with respect to PHI, this BAA will be deemed to be automatically amended such that the obligations imposed on the parties remain in compliance with such regulations. If any term or condition of this BAA conflicts with the Services Agreement or DPA, the terms of this BAA will prevail.

Counterparty will be responsible for any actions taken by its authorized auditor. All information disclosed by Merge under this Section 9 will be deemed Merge Confidential Information, and Counterparty will not disclose any audit report to any third party except as obligated by law, court order or administrative order by a government agency. Merge will remediate any mutually agreed, material deficiencies in its technical and organizational measures identified by the audit procedures described in this Section 9 within a mutually agreeable timeframe.
142 | 
143 | 10. **Breach notification**
144 | 
145 | If Merge becomes aware of a Data Breach that results in unlawful or unauthorized access to, or loss, disclosure, or alteration of the Personal Data, then Merge will notify the Counterparty without undue delay and in any event, within seventy-two hours after becoming aware of such Data Breach and will co-operate with the Counterparty and take such reasonable commercial steps as agreed with the Counterparty to assist in the investigation, mitigation and remediation of such Data Breach. Merge will provide all reasonably required support and cooperation necessary to enable Counterparty to comply with its legal obligations in case of a Data Breach pursuant to applicable Data Protection Laws.
146 | 
147 | 11. **Sub-processing.**
148 | 
149 | Counterparty agrees that Merge may engage either Merge affiliated companies or third parties providers as “Subprocessors” and hereby authorizes Merge to engage such Subprocessors in the provision of the Service. Merge will restrict the Processing activities performed by Subprocessors to only what is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Agreement and this DPA. Merge will impose appropriate contractual obligations in writing upon the Subprocessors that are no less protective than this DPA, and Merge will remain responsible for the Subprocessors’ compliance with the obligations under this DPA.
150 | 
151 | Merge maintains a list of all Subprocessors at www.merge.dev/data-subprocessors (Annex III). Merge may amend the list of Subprocessors by adding or replacing Subprocessors at any time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Counterparty with fifteen (15) days’ advance notice of any updates so long as Counterparty subscribes to Merge’s notification list. Controller will be entitled to object to a new Subprocessor by notifying Merge in writing the reasons of its objection. Merge will work in good faith to address Controller’s objections. If Merge is unable or unwilling to adequately address Controller’s objections to its reasonable satisfaction, then Controller may terminate this DPA and the Agreement, as specified in the Agreement.
152 | 
153 | 12. **Governing Law.**
154 | 
155 | This Addendum shall be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by applicable Data Protection Laws. For the purposes of Clauses 17 and 18 of the EU SCCs, where applicable, to the extent that the governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement do not meet the requirements of the EU SCCs, the parties select Option 2 of Clause 17, and agree that the EU SCCs shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established; where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, the EU SCCs shall be governed by the laws of the country of Ireland. Pursuant to Clause 18, any dispute between the Parties arising from the EU SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland, and the Parties submit themselves to such jurisdiction. For the purposes of Clause 13 of the EU SCCs, the Supervisory Authority shall be the data exporter’s applicable Supervisory Authority. Data exporter shall notify data importer of the applicable Supervisory Authority by email at legal@merge.dev and shall provide any necessary updates without undue delay.
156 | 
157 | 13. **Return or Deletion of Personal Data.**
158 | 
159 | Unless otherwise required by applicable Data Protection Laws, Merge will delete or return, in Counterparty’s discretion and upon Counterparty’s written request, Personal Data within a reasonable period of time following the termination or expiration of the Agreement.
160 | 
161 | 14. **Termination.**
162 | 
163 | This Addendum shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement. This Addendum cannot, in principle, be terminated separately to the Agreement, except where the Processing ends before the termination of the Agreement, in which case, this Addendum shall automatically terminate.
164 | 
165 | 15. **Entire Agreement; Conflict.**
166 | 
167 | Except as amended by this DPA, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If there is a conflict between the Agreement and this DPA, the terms of this DPA will control.

272 | Merge’s Change Management Process and Standard governs the system development life cycle, including documented policies for tracking, testing, approving, and validating changes.
273 | System changes are tested via automated test scripts prior to being deployed into production.
274 | Code merge requests are independently peer reviewed prior to integrating the code change into the master branch.
275 | System users who make changes to the development system are unable to deploy their changes to production without independent approval.
276 | The Engineering team uses a tool to enforce standard production images for production servers.
277 | Configuration changes are tested (if applicable) and approved prior to being deployed into production.
278 | The production and testing environments are segregated; production data is not used in the development and testing environments.
279 | 
280 | #### Data and Availability Controls
281 | 
282 | Merge’s Data Protection Policy details the security and handling protocols for service data.

 48 | 
 49 | These End User Terms of Service (“ **Terms**”) govern use of the Service (as defined below) by End User to enable one or more Integrations (each as defined below) that are made available by Merge API, Inc. (“ **Merge**”).
 50 | 
 51 | “ **End User**” means the entity that accepts and agrees to these Terms either by clicking a button indicating its acceptance of these Terms and/or by using the Service to enable an Integration (as defined below).
 52 | 
 53 | Merge reserves the right to update these Terms in its sole discretion. The effective date of each update will be (i) 30 days from the date of such update, or (ii) End User’s continued use of an Integration, whichever is earlier.
 54 | 
 55 | IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICE TO ENABLE AN INTEGRATION. THE SERVICE IS INTENDED FOR END USER AND ITS AUTHORIZED USERS ONLY AND IS NOT FOR USE BY CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE. IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, SUCH PERSON REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND THESE TERMS APPLY TO SUCH ENTITY WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE END USER.
 56 |

 78 | 
 79 | 1. **ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE**
 80 | 
 81 | 1.1
 82 | 
 83 | _Right to Access and Use Service._ Merge provides the Service to its customer (the Vendor) and processes End User Data on its behalf. In order to do so, Merge grants End User the right to enable one or more Integrations for the purpose of receiving products or services from the Vendor. Use of the Service requires Merge to share End User’s company name with the Partners whose applications End User connects to an Integration.
 84 | 
 85 | 1.2
 86 | 
 87 | _Data License._ By enabling an Integration, End User will transfer End User Data to Merge so that Merge can make such data available to the Vendor by means of the Services, and End User grants Merge a limited license during the Term to do so.
 88 | 
 89 | 1.3
 90 | 
 91 | _Restrictions._ End User will not: (a) access (or allow a third party to access) the Service in order to benchmark, or monitor the availability, security, performance, or functionality of the Service, for any competitive purposes without Merge’s express written consent; (b) rent, lease or otherwise permit third parties (or other persons not authorized by these Terms) to use the Service; (c) use the Service to provide services to third parties (e.g., End User cannot use the Service as a service bureau); (d) modify, create derivative works, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to gain access to the source code, or copy the Service, or any of their components; (e) circumvent or disable any security or other technological features or measures of the Service or use the Service in a manner that Merge reasonably believes poses a threat to the security of Merge-controlled computer systems; or (f) use the Service to conduct any fraudulent, malicious, or illegal activities.
 92 |

103 | 3. **TERMINATION & SURVIVAL**
104 | 
105 | 3.1
106 | 
107 | _Merge Suspension & Termination Rights._ Generally, the Integration(s) will continue only for so long as the Vendor maintains an active subscription to the Service. Merge may immediately suspend these Terms upon notice to End User or to the Vendor (which may take the form of an e-mail in either case) if Merge reasonably believes that End User has violated these Terms. If such violation remains uncured after 30 days, Merge may terminate these Terms and disable the Integration(s).
108 | 
109 | 3.2
110 | 
111 | _End User Termination Rights._ End User may terminate these Terms at any time, either by instructing a Vendor to do so on End User’s behalf via the Service, or by severing all of its API connections to the Service and notifying Merge in writing of such termination.
112 | 
113 | 3.3
114 | 
115 | _Effect of Termination._ Upon any termination by End User, or by Vendor acting at the direction of End User, Merge will delete all End User Data from the Service generally within 90 days from the date of such termination.
116 | 
117 | 3.4
118 | 
119 | _Survival._ Sections 4 and 5 will survive any expiration or termination of these Terms.
120 | 
121 | 4. **OWNERSHIP**
122 | 
123 | 4.1
124 | 
125 | _Merge Property._ As between the parties, Merge owns and retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Service. Except for the limited license granted to End User in Section 1.1, Merge does not by means of these Terms or otherwise transfer any rights in the Service to End User. End User will take no action inconsistent with Merge’s intellectual property rights in the Service.
126 | 
127 | 4.2
128 | 
129 | _End User Property._ As between the parties, End User owns and retains all right, title, and interest in and to the End User Data and does not by means of these Terms or otherwise transfer any rights in the End User Data to Merge, except for the limited license granted to Merge in Section 1.3.

We use the data collected by such third parties to administer and improve the quality of the Services, analyze usage of the Services, and provide a more enhanced user experience on the Services, such as personalizing and delivering relevant offers and content based on user activity on the Services. We do not provide these third parties with your Personal Information.
123 | 
124 | We may use third party analytics services (such as Google Analytics and other similar services) to collect and process certain analytics data. These services may also collect information about your use of other websites, apps, and online resources.

 48 | ## Globalization isn’t going anywhere
 49 | 
 50 | Whether you're gearing up for expansion or already serving global markets, you know the check-list of requirements needed to make a product successful in a new geography.
 51 | 
 52 | After all, expansion isn’t about making new landing pages or hiring more people. You also need to localize your product and integrations to meet the needs of the customers you’re serving.
 53 | 
 54 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67c1d90948514286c50e7488_5ace266533cd0769ebf51c8957f2fae6_Globalization.svg)
 55 | 
 56 | ## Merge provides crystal clear localization for your integrations
 57 | 
 58 | Merge is the only Unified API to fully incorporate dynamic end-user localization. That means every aspect of your customer’s onboarding experience is translated and maintained by Merge.
 59 | 
 60 | No lost context, no lost customers.

 91 | 
 92 | ### Easy onboarding
 93 | 
 94 | Merge Link is the way your customers onboard to and authenticate their integration in minutes. From start to finish, every screen populates with the language your customer speaks.
 95 | 
 96 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67c1e1382080c3aec2bc228c_card-2.svg)
 97 | 
 98 | ### Helpful error messages
 99 | 
100 | Your customers make mistakes. We help fix them. Merge writes and maintains integration-specific error messages for every integration and every language we support.
101 | 
102 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67c1e139c03020a671288ce0_card-3.svg)
103 | 
104 | ### Never worry about localization maintenance
105 | 
106 | As you expand, Merge handles both adding additional languages and localizing instructions for new integrations too. As onboarding steps change, we update them — don’t worry.

182 | ## Focus on building the best product
183 | 
184 | Allow your developers to concentrate on what’s important: your core product — not integrations.

188 | ### Hard to access
189 | 
190 | Getting access to partnerships and APIs are not only difficult, but expensive

194 | ### Hard to build
195 | 
196 | Working with unhelpful third-party API docs and nonexistent support is a headache

199 | 
200 | ### Hard to scale
201 | 
202 | Achieving product market fit will come with more integration requests from customers

 28 | Merge vs. Apideck
 29 | 
 30 | # Merge is the most reliable Unified API built for scale
 31 | 
 32 | ‍
 33 | 
 34 | - Merge is G2’s top Unified API platform, delivering best-in-class implementation and support services, while Apideck lags behind
 35 | - Apideck does not pre-fetch customer data making it unscalable; Merge ensures persistent, predictable, and consistent syncing
 36 | - Apideck is priced by API call volume, leading to unpredictable and unscalable costs. With Merge, there are no pricing surprises.

 41 | 
 42 | ## 01
 43 | 
 44 | ### Merge is G2’s leading Unified API platform, and your long-term, secure integration partner
 45 | 
 46 | At a tenth of Merge’s size, Apideck lacks the resources needed to support you, your integrations, and your customers. From implementation to adoption, Merge is a partnership that prioritizes customer support and success. Our 100+ G2 reviews from extremely satisfied customers speak for itself.
 47 | 
 48 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67b5d540e9d433286bb39700_apideck_1.svg)
 49 | 
 50 | ## 02
 51 | 
 52 | ### Apideck does not pre-fetch data, which leads to unpredictable and inconsistent data syncs
 53 | 
 54 | Apideck’s Unified API only accesses data when an API call is made, leading to unreliable syncs due to third-party provider rate limits and data structures. Merge’s secure infrastructure and storing of data means instant data access with consistent, reliable syncs.
 55 | 
 56 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67b5d5f02c3b46017f5a667f_apideck_2.svg)
 57 | 
 58 | ## 03
 59 | 
 60 | ### Merge offers transparent pricing, whereas Apideck is unpredictable and costly
 61 | 
 62 | Apideck charges based on how many API calls you make, which is determined by the integration provider. This leads to unpredictable pricing and increasing costs as you scale.
 63 | 
 64 | Merge switched from API call pricing to a flat rate per connection, offering more transparent and predictable pricing model that aligns with your business needs.
 65 |

 30 | # Merge is your long-term partner to power your accounting integrations
 31 | 
 32 | ‍
 33 | 
 34 | - Codat is deprioritizing their accounting Unified API; Merge is constantly adding accounting integrations and capabilities
 35 | - Codat doesn’t allow you to access custom data; Merge provides full flexibility and extensibility
 36 | - Codat’s async POST requests delay data reconciliation and are error-prone, while Merge syncs instantly when you write data

 42 | ## 01
 43 | 
 44 | ### With regular product updates, Merge provides trusted, high-quality accounting integrations
 45 | 
 46 | Codat has completely stopped investing in their accounting integrations to focus on other parts of their business. They’ve already deprecated endpoints that support key accounting use cases.
 47 | 
 48 | Merge is committed to enhancing and developing new accounting integrations and capabilities. In addition to our product investments, Merge leads the market in customer satisfaction, support, and implementation.

 54 | ### Merge supports your custom data needs, offering complete data flexibility and extensibility
 55 | 
 56 | Anything that’s possible by building natively is possible through Merge. Access any custom accounting objects and fields beyond Merge’s Common Models.
 57 | 
 58 | Codat does not support passthrough data, limiting what data you can access outside of their defined Common Models.

 61 | 
 62 | ## 03
 63 | 
 64 | ### POST data without the lag – Merge processes your requests immediately
 65 | 
 66 | Codat batches POST requests async, meaning delays when writing data to your customers’ accounting platform. These async calls are extremely error-prone, requiring idempotency and heavy infrastructure builds to determine if writes succeed.
 67 | 
 68 | Merge's architecture is fundamentally different, with immediate syncs, where possible, when writing data. Merge is built for real-time use cases, never waiting to process your POST requests.

 29 | 
 30 | # The Unified API for customizability
 31 | 
 32 | Merge is a Unified API for customer-facing integrations. Embedded integration platform as a service (iPaaS) is a low-code tool.
 33 | 
 34 | With Merge, you only need to build once. Merge also offers the same depth of data extensibility as an embedded iPaaS.

 40 | ## 01
 41 | 
 42 | ### Stop maintaining one-off integrations
 43 | 
 44 | Merge allows your app to connect to an entire category of software through a single integration. Unlike an embedded iPaaS, you won’t need to use developer resources to build one-to-one integrations for each platform you want to support.
 45 | 
 46 | #### With Merge

 48 | Build once to a Unified API

 60 | ### Access any piece of data with a single API
 61 | 
 62 | Whether you need to read and write custom objects or custom fields and attributes, Merge supports you with features that enable deep data coverage in a single build

 80 | ### Merge supports the entire integration lifecycle while an embedded iPaaS puts the burden on you
 81 | 
 82 | Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.
 83 | 
 84 | An embedded iPaaS requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.

 30 | # Merge offers 2x more API-based HRIS integrations than Finch
 31 | 
 32 | ‍
 33 | 
 34 | - Merge only offers secure API integrations, so your customers’ data and security are never compromised
 35 | - Merge prioritizes customer support and integration reliability
 36 | - Merge is built for scale

 43 | 
 44 | ### Merge is API first, with 70+ HRIS integrations for secure, accurate, and real-time data
 45 | 
 46 | If you care about your customers’ data security and quality, API-first matters.
 47 | 
 48 | ‍
 49 | 
 50 | With Finch “Assisted Integrations”, you’ll compromise your customers’ PII data by giving unknown individuals access to your customers’ HR platform. Merge never does that.
 51 |

 53 | 
 54 | ## 02
 55 | 
 56 | ### There’s never a wait (for data or support) when using Merge
 57 | 
 58 | Merge has daily, if not hourly data syncs, and offers same day support SLAs, plus Webhooks and implementation packages.
 59 | 
 60 | Finch takes up to 2 weeks to sync your customers’ data, and has slow customer support. Don't find yourself without data, help, or answers when you need them.

 63 | 
 64 | ## 03
 65 | 
 66 | ### The only unified API built for scale
 67 | 
 68 | Merge is the only Unified API that offers enterprise-ready security and features, built for companies that want white-glove security, support, and infrastructure.
 69 | 
 70 | Feel confident that your Unified API provider is built for your enterprise requirements.

 29 | 
 30 | # Build once with Merge or build 200+ times with Paragon
 31 | 
 32 | ‍
 33 | 
 34 | - With Merge’s Unified API, build just once to add 200+ product integrations; Paragon requires you to build each one separately
 35 | - Paragon places more burden on your engineers while Merge handles both maintenance and observability
 36 | - Access any data you need — Merge offers deeper data customization and extensibility than Paragon

 41 | 
 42 | ## 01
 43 | 
 44 | ### Paragon doesn’t solve the pain of building and maintaining every integration – Merge does
 45 | 
 46 | Paragon’s embedded iPaaS is unscalable; it requires you to individually build and maintain integrations for every single platform in their rigid, non-developer friendly tool.
 47 | 
 48 | With Merge, instantly scale your product integrations by accessing 200+ integrations across 6 key categories including HRIS, ticketing, and accounting.
 49 | 
 50 | #### With Merge
 51 | 
 52 | Build once to a Unified API
 53 | 
 54 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67bb2c369ce5a689dcd76d03_paragon-1-1.svg)
 55 | 
 56 | #### With Paragon
 57 | 
 58 | You build each integration 1 by 1, and building still requires engineers
 59 | 
 60 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67bb2c6bcabf6acfef322b70_paragon-1-2.svg)
 61 | 
 62 | ## 02
 63 | 
 64 | ### Merge supports the entire integration lifecycle while Paragon puts the burden on you
 65 | 
 66 | Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.
 67 | 
 68 | Paragon requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.
 69 | 
 70 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67cb153d812b94278eef99d7_paragon03-vs.avif)
 71 | 
 72 | ## 03
 73 | 
 74 | ### Paragon claims customization, but Merge actually delivers deeper, more extensible data
 75 | 
 76 | Anything that’s possible by building natively is possible through Merge. Read and write any custom objects and fields outside of our Merge’s Common Models.
 77 | 
 78 | Paragon only allows you to map fields in their low-code platform and places the responsibility on your customers; with Merge you have the flexibility to do it programmatically or in our dashboard.

 30 | # Merge is the only enterprise-ready accounting Unified API
 31 | 
 32 | ‍
 33 | 
 34 | - Rutter's async POST requests delay data reconciliation and are error-prone, while Merge syncs instantly when you write data
 35 | - Merge is built for enterprise needs; Rutter is unable to handle large syncs and has limited custom data support
 36 | - Recognized by G2 for best-in-class implementation and support, Merge is your trusted integration partner

 41 | 
 42 | ## 01
 43 | 
 44 | ### Skip the wait when writing data — Merge processes your POST requests synchronously
 45 | 
 46 | Rutter batches POST requests async without notifying you when they will actually occur, leaving you and your customers waiting for data. These async calls are extremely error-prone, requiring idempotency and heavy infrastructure builds to determine if writes succeed.
 47 | 
 48 | Merge's architecture is fundamentally different, with immediate syncs when you need to write data. Merge is built for real-time use cases, never waiting to process your POST requests.
 49 | 
 50 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67bb237bf0cc6a61d5bbf8fe_rutter-1.svg)
 51 | 
 52 | ## 02
 53 | 
 54 | ### Don’t limit yourself — choose Merge for enterprise scale and custom data support
 55 | 
 56 | Rutter breaks when syncing large enterprise accounts like NetSuite and lacks basic accounting features like general ledger transaction data. Rutter also has minimal support for custom fields.
 57 | 
 58 | Merge is built for enterprise: high quality, stable integrations with deeper accounting and custom field coverage.
 59 | 
 60 | ![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/624b192df0b0151225c10026/67bb23b73ef9704372416820_rutter-2.svg)
 61 | 
 62 | ## 03
 63 | 
 64 | ### Rutter is an unproven tool. Merge is your long-term partner, with superior support and implementation.
 65 | 
 66 | From implementation to adoption, Merge prioritizes the highest quality of customer support and success. With 100+ G2 reviews from highly satisfied customers, our track record speaks for itself.
 67 | 
 68 | At a quarter of Merge's size, Rutter lacks the resources needed to support you, your integrations, and your customers.

 79 | 
 80 | Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.
 81 | 
 82 | Tray requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.

 80 | ### Merge supports the entire integration lifecycle while Workato puts the burden on you
 81 | 
 82 | Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.
 83 | 
 84 | Workato requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.
