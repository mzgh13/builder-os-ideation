## 01

### Merge is API first, with 70+ HRIS integrations for secure, accurate, and real-time data

If you care about your customers’ data security and quality, API-first matters.

‍

With Finch “Assisted Integrations”, you’ll compromise your customers’ PII data by giving unknown individuals access to your customers’ HR platform. Merge never does that.

## 02

### There’s never a wait (for data or support) when using Merge

Merge has daily, if not hourly data syncs, and offers same day support SLAs, plus Webhooks and implementation packages.

Finch takes up to 2 weeks to sync your customers’ data, and has slow customer support. Don't find yourself without data, help, or answers when you need them.

## 03

### The only unified API built for scale

Merge is the only Unified API that offers enterprise-ready security and features, built for companies that want white-glove security, support, and infrastructure.

Feel confident that your Unified API provider is built for your enterprise requirements.

Arrow Right](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/how-causal-sped-up-their-self-serve-time-to-value-by-20-with-merge)

We initially used Finch (another unified API solution) to build out HRIS integrations, but the quality of their integrations were pretty poor. For instance, unlike Merge, their integrations can only access a limited scope of data from 3rd-party systems.
