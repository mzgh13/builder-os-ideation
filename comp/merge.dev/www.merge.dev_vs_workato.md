Merge vs. Workato

# The Unified API for customizability

Merge is a Unified API for customer-facing integrations. Workato Embedded is a one-to-one workflow product.

But did you know Merge is significantly less work to maintain and offers the same depth as Workato?

## 01

### Stop maintaining one-off integrations

Merge allows your app to connect to an entire category of software through a single integration. Unlike Workato, you won’t need to use developer resources to build one-to-one integrations for each platform you want to support.

#### With Merge

Build once to a Unified API

#### With Workato

Integrate with each individual API

### Access any piece of data with a single API

Whether you need to read and write custom objects or custom fields and attributes, Merge supports you with features that enable deep data coverage in a single build

### Merge supports the entire integration lifecycle while Workato puts the burden on you

Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.

Workato requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.

#### How Bonusly built their HRIS integrations 20x faster using Merge instead of an Embedded iPaaS

Arrow Right](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/bonusly)

“Embedded iPaaS solutions require extensive customizations and force you to build one integration at a time, which isn’t scalable. With Merge, we can build once and access dozens of customizable HRIS integrations that are ready out-of-the-box.”
