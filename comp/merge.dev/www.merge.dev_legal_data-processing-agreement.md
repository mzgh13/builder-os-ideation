8. **Data Protection Impact Assessments.**

If Counterparty is required under the Data Protection Laws to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment, then upon written request from Counterparty, Merge will assist where reasonably possible in the fulfilment of the Counterparty’s obligation as related to its use of the Service, to the extent Counterparty does not otherwise have access to the relevant information. If required under Data Protection Laws Merge will provide reasonable assistance to Counterparty in the cooperation or prior consultation with Data Protection Authorities in relation to any applicable Data Protection Impact Assessment.

9. **Audit of Technical and Organizational Measures.**

Merge agrees to make available all information necessary to demonstrate its compliance with data protection policies and procedures implemented as part of the Service. To this end, upon written request (not more than once annually) Counterparty may, at its sole cost and expense, verify Merge’s compliance with its data protection obligations as specified in this DPA by: (i) submitting a security assessment questionnaire to Merge; and (ii) if Counterparty is not satisfied with Merge’s responses to the questionnaire, then Counterparty may conduct an audit in the form of meetings with Merge’s information security experts upon a mutually agreeable date. Such interviews will be conducted with a minimum of disruption to Merge’s normal business operations and subject always to Merge’s agreement on scope and timings. The Counterparty may perform the audit described above either by itself or through a mutually agreed upon third party auditor, provided that Counterparty or its authorized auditor executes a mutually agreed upon non-disclosure agreement. Counterparty will be responsible for any actions taken by its authorized auditor. All information disclosed by Merge under this Section 9 will be deemed Merge Confidential Information, and Counterparty will not disclose any audit report to any third party except as obligated by law, court order or administrative order by a government agency.

If Merge becomes aware of a Data Breach that results in unlawful or unauthorized access to, or loss, disclosure, or alteration of the Personal Data, then Merge will notify the Counterparty without undue delay and in any event, within seventy-two hours after becoming aware of such Data Breach and will co-operate with the Counterparty and take such reasonable commercial steps as agreed with the Counterparty to assist in the investigation, mitigation and remediation of such Data Breach. Merge will provide all reasonably required support and cooperation necessary to enable Counterparty to comply with its legal obligations in case of a Data Breach pursuant to applicable Data Protection Laws.

11. **Sub-processing.**

Counterparty agrees that Merge may engage either Merge affiliated companies or third parties providers as “Subprocessors” and hereby authorizes Merge to engage such Subprocessors in the provision of the Service. Merge will restrict the Processing activities performed by Subprocessors to only what is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Agreement and this DPA. Merge will impose appropriate contractual obligations in writing upon the Subprocessors that are no less protective than this DPA, and Merge will remain responsible for the Subprocessors’ compliance with the obligations under this DPA.

Merge maintains a list of all Subprocessors at www.merge.dev/data-subprocessors (Annex III). Merge may amend the list of Subprocessors by adding or replacing Subprocessors at any time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Counterparty with fifteen (15) days’ advance notice of any updates so long as Counterparty subscribes to Merge’s notification list. Controller will be entitled to object to a new Subprocessor by notifying Merge in writing the reasons of its objection. Merge will work in good faith to address Controller’s objections. If Merge is unable or unwilling to adequately address Controller’s objections to its reasonable satisfaction, then Controller may terminate this DPA and the Agreement, as specified in the Agreement.

12. **Governing Law.**

This Addendum shall be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by applicable Data Protection Laws. For the purposes of Clauses 17 and 18 of the EU SCCs, where applicable, to the extent that the governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement do not meet the requirements of the EU SCCs, the parties select Option 2 of Clause 17, and agree that the EU SCCs shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established; where such law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, the EU SCCs shall be governed by the laws of the country of Ireland. Pursuant to Clause 18, any dispute between the Parties arising from the EU SCCs shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland, and the Parties submit themselves to such jurisdiction. For the purposes of Clause 13 of the EU SCCs, the Supervisory Authority shall be the data exporter’s applicable Supervisory Authority. Data exporter shall notify data importer of the applicable Supervisory Authority by email at legal@merge.dev and shall provide any necessary updates without undue delay.

13. **Return or Deletion of Personal Data.**

Unless otherwise required by applicable Data Protection Laws, Merge will delete or return, in Counterparty’s discretion and upon Counterparty’s written request, Personal Data within a reasonable period of time following the termination or expiration of the Agreement.

14. **Termination.**

This Addendum shall automatically terminate upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement. This Addendum cannot, in principle, be terminated separately to the Agreement, except where the Processing ends before the termination of the Agreement, in which case, this Addendum shall automatically terminate.

15. **Entire Agreement; Conflict.**

Except as amended by this DPA, the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If there is a conflict between the Agreement and this DPA, the terms of this DPA will control.
