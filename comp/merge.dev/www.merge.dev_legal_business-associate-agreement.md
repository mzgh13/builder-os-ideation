Capitalized terms used in this BAA will have the meanings as defined under applicable law, as set forth herein or in the Services Agreement or DPA between Merge and the Counterparty._

B.

_The parties may maintain, transmit, create or receive data that constitutes PHI to perform tasks on behalf of Covered Entity and/or Business Associate as applicable pursuant to the terms of this BAA;_

C.

_To the extent required by the HIPAA Regulations and applicable state law, the parties may be directly subject to certain privacy and security obligations and penalty provisions of HIPAA, HITECH, the HIPAA Regulations and state law._

The parties agree as follows:

1. Use and Disclosure

a.

_Each party will comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Regulations and this BAA that apply to its Role._

b.

_A party may use and disclose PHI only as permitted or required by this BAA or as required by law._

c.

_To the extent a party receives notice of a reasonable restriction from Covered Entity that would limit its use or disclosure of PHI: (i) Business Associate will promptly notify Subcontractor of such restriction; and (ii) each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the restriction applicable to their Role._

d.

_For clarity, if Subcontractor handles PHI on behalf of Business Associate, the terms and conditions of this BAA that apply to Business Associate apply with equal force and effect to Subcontractor._

2. Appropriate Safeguards. Business Associate and Subcontractor agree to maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect PHI from uses or disclosures not permitted by this BAA, including maintaining policies and procedures to detect, prevent or mitigate identity theft based on PHI or information derived from PHI. Business Associate and Subcontractor agree to comply with the applicable requirements of the HIPAA Regulations with respect to electronic PHI and any guidance issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“ **HHS**”).

3. Incident Notification.

a.

_If Merge becomes aware of or discovers any use or disclosure of PHI in violation of this BAA, any Personal Data Breach (as defined in the DPA) involving PHI, or any Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information (each as defined in the HIPAA Regulations) related to any individual who is the subject of PHI, Merge will promptly report such use, disclosure, incident, or breach to Covered Entity and Counterparty and shall include the information specified in the HIPAA Regulations. Merge will mitigate, to the extent practicable, any harmful effect known to it of a use or disclosure of PHI by Merge not permitted by this BAA._

b.

_If Counterparty becomes aware of any use or disclosure of PHI in violation of this BAA, or any Breach of Unsecured Protected Health Information related to any individual who is the subject of PHI, Counterparty will promptly report such use, disclosure, incident, or breach to Covered Entity and Counterparty and shall include the information specified in the HIPAA Regulations.

If the requested PHI is maintained electronically, Business Associate or Subcontractor will provide a copy of the PHI in the electronic form and format requested by the individual, if it is readily producible, or, if not, in a readable electronic form and format as agreed to by Covered Entity and the individual. If any individual requests access to PHI directly from Business Associate or Subcontractor, Business Associate or Subcontractor will within ten (10) days forward such request to Covered Entity. Any denials of access to the PHI requested shall be the responsibility of Covered Entity.

5. Amendments to Designated Record Sets. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of a request from Covered Entity for the amendment of an individual’s PHI contained in a Designated Record Set (for so long as the PHI is maintained in the Designated Record Set), Business Associate or Subcontractor will provide such information to Covered Entity for amendment and incorporate any such amendments in the PHI. In the event a request for an amendment is delivered directly to Business Associate or Subcontractor, Business Associate or Subcontractor shall within ten (10) days of receiving such request forward the request to Covered Entity.

a.

_use the PHI for its proper management and administration and to carry out its legal responsibilities;_

b.

_disclose PHI for its proper management and administration and to carry out its legal responsibilities, provided that disclosures do not violate the HIPAA Regulations;_

c.

_use and disclose PHI to report violations of law to appropriate Federal and State authorities;_

d.

_aggregate the PHI in its possession with the PHI of other covered entities that it has in its possession through its Role to other covered entities, provided that such aggregation conforms to the requirements of the HIPAA Regulations; and_

e.

_use PHI to create de-identified information, and use such de-identified information for its own purposes, provided that the de-identification and use thereof conforms to the requirements of the HIPAA Regulations._

9. Responsibilities of the Business Associate with Subcontractor. If applicable, for the use and/or disclosure of PHI by Subcontractor, Business Associate agrees:

a.

_To inform Subcontractor of any changes in the notice of privacy practices (“_ **_Notice_** _”) that Business Associate provides, directly or indirectly, to individuals pursuant to the HIPAA Regulations, that affect Subcontractor’s use or disclosure of PHI, and provide to Subcontractor, upon request, a copy of the Notice currently in use._

b.

_To inform Subcontractor of any changes in, or revocation of, the authorization provided to Business Associate by individuals pursuant to HIPAA Regulations, to the extent relevant to the Services being provided under the Services Agreement._

c.

_To inform Subcontractor of any opt-outs exercised by any individual from fundraising activities of Business Associate pursuant to HIPAA Regulations, to the extent relevant to the Services being provided under the Services Agreement._

d.

_To notify Subcontractor, in writing and in a timely manner, of any arrangements permitted or required of Business Associate under HIPAA Regulations that may impact in any manner the use and/or disclosure of PHI required by Subcontractor under this BAA, including, but not limited to, agreed upon restrictions regarding the use and/or disclosure of PHI as provided for in HIPAA Regulations._

10. HIPAA Transaction Standards. If Business Associate or Subcontractor conducts standard transactions (as defined in the HIPAA Regulations) for or on behalf of Covered Entity, Business Associate or Subcontractor will comply and will require by written contract each agent or contractor (including any subcontractor) involved with the conduct of such standard transactions to comply, with each applicable requirement of the HIPAA Regulations. Neither Business Associate nor Subcontractor will enter into, or permit its agents or contractors (including subcontractors) to enter into, any trading partner agreement in connection with the conduct of standard transactions for or on behalf of Covered Entity that: (a) changes the definition, data condition, or use of a data element or segment in a standard transaction; (b) adds any data elements or segments to the maximum defined data set; (c) uses any code or data element that is marked “not used” in the standard transaction’s implementation specification or is not in the standard transaction’s implementation specification; or (d) changes the meaning or intent of the standard transaction’s implementation specification. Business Associate and Subcontractor agree to participate in any test modification conducted by Covered Entity in accordance with the HIPAA Regulations.
11. Term and Termination. This BAA remains in effect until the Services Agreement is terminated or expires. Either party may terminate this BAA and the Services Agreement effective immediately if it determines that the other party has breached a material provision of this BAA and failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of being notified by the other party of the breach. If the non-breaching party determines that cure is not possible, such party may terminate this BAA and the Services Agreement effective immediately upon written notice to other party.
12. Limitation of Liability. This BAA is subject to the limitations on liability set forth in the Services Agreement.
13. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this BAA, Merge agrees to either return or destroy, at no cost to Counterparty, all PHI that Merge maintains in any form. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that it is not feasible to return or destroy such PHI, the terms and provisions of this BAA shall survive termination of this BAA, and Merge will only use or disclose such PHI solely for such purpose or purposes which prevented the return or destruction of such PHI.
14. Miscellaneous. To the extent Business Associate is acting as a business associate under the HIPAA Regulations, Business Associate shall be subject to the penalty provisions specified in HITECH. Upon the effective date of any final regulation or amendment to final regulations promulgated by HHS with respect to PHI, this BAA will be deemed to be automatically amended such that the obligations imposed on the parties remain in compliance with such regulations. If any term or condition of this BAA conflicts with the Services Agreement or DPA, the terms of this BAA will prevail.
