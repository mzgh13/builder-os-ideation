Merge vs. Codat

# Merge is your long-term partner to power your accounting integrations

‍

- Codat is deprioritizing their accounting Unified API; Merge is constantly adding accounting integrations and capabilities
- Codat doesn’t allow you to access custom data; Merge provides full flexibility and extensibility
- Codat’s async POST requests delay data reconciliation and are error-prone, while Merge syncs instantly when you write data

## 01

### With regular product updates, Merge provides trusted, high-quality accounting integrations

Codat has completely stopped investing in their accounting integrations to focus on other parts of their business. They’ve already deprecated endpoints that support key accounting use cases.

Merge is committed to enhancing and developing new accounting integrations and capabilities. In addition to our product investments, Merge leads the market in customer satisfaction, support, and implementation.

## 02

### Merge supports your custom data needs, offering complete data flexibility and extensibility

Anything that’s possible by building natively is possible through Merge. Access any custom accounting objects and fields beyond Merge’s Common Models.

Codat does not support passthrough data, limiting what data you can access outside of their defined Common Models.

## 03

### POST data without the lag – Merge processes your requests immediately

Codat batches POST requests async, meaning delays when writing data to your customers’ accounting platform. These async calls are extremely error-prone, requiring idempotency and heavy infrastructure builds to determine if writes succeed.

Merge's architecture is fundamentally different, with immediate syncs, where possible, when writing data. Merge is built for real-time use cases, never waiting to process your POST requests.
