The terms and conditions set forth herein constitute the entire agreement between you and Merge with respect to the use of the Site. The waiver by one party of any default of the other party shall not waive subsequent defaults of the same or different kind. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
