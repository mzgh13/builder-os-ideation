Merge vs. Apideck

# Merge is the most reliable Unified API built for scale

‍

- Merge is G2’s top Unified API platform, delivering best-in-class implementation and support services, while Apideck lags behind
- Apideck does not pre-fetch customer data making it unscalable; Merge ensures persistent, predictable, and consistent syncing
- Apideck is priced by API call volume, leading to unpredictable and unscalable costs. With Merge, there are no pricing surprises.

## 01

### Merge is G2’s leading Unified API platform, and your long-term, secure integration partner

At a tenth of Merge’s size, Apideck lacks the resources needed to support you, your integrations, and your customers. From implementation to adoption, Merge is a partnership that prioritizes customer support and success. Our 100+ G2 reviews from extremely satisfied customers speak for itself.

## 02

### Apideck does not pre-fetch data, which leads to unpredictable and inconsistent data syncs

Apideck’s Unified API only accesses data when an API call is made, leading to unreliable syncs due to third-party provider rate limits and data structures. Merge’s secure infrastructure and storing of data means instant data access with consistent, reliable syncs.

## 03

### Merge offers transparent pricing, whereas Apideck is unpredictable and costly

Apideck charges based on how many API calls you make, which is determined by the integration provider. This leads to unpredictable pricing and increasing costs as you scale.

Merge switched from API call pricing to a flat rate per connection, offering more transparent and predictable pricing model that aligns with your business needs.
