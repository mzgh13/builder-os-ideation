Merge vs. Rutter

# Merge is the only enterprise-ready accounting Unified API

‍

- Rutter's async POST requests delay data reconciliation and are error-prone, while Merge syncs instantly when you write data
- Merge is built for enterprise needs; Rutter is unable to handle large syncs and has limited custom data support
- Recognized by G2 for best-in-class implementation and support, Merge is your trusted integration partner

## 01

### Skip the wait when writing data — Merge processes your POST requests synchronously

Rutter batches POST requests async without notifying you when they will actually occur, leaving you and your customers waiting for data. These async calls are extremely error-prone, requiring idempotency and heavy infrastructure builds to determine if writes succeed.

Merge's architecture is fundamentally different, with immediate syncs when you need to write data. Merge is built for real-time use cases, never waiting to process your POST requests.

## 02

### Don’t limit yourself — choose Merge for enterprise scale and custom data support

Rutter breaks when syncing large enterprise accounts like NetSuite and lacks basic accounting features like general ledger transaction data. Rutter also has minimal support for custom fields.

Merge is built for enterprise: high quality, stable integrations with deeper accounting and custom field coverage.

## 03

### Rutter is an unproven tool. Merge is your long-term partner, with superior support and implementation.

From implementation to adoption, Merge prioritizes the highest quality of customer support and success. With 100+ G2 reviews from highly satisfied customers, our track record speaks for itself.

At a quarter of Merge's size, Rutter lacks the resources needed to support you, your integrations, and your customers.

“We looked at Rutter, but they aren’t as well documented and require too much development work. Merge won us over with \[synchronous\] Passthrough and its flexibility with specific customer setups. It has been so critical to get the level of specificity that we want.”
