## Blueprint Terms of Use

These Blueprint Terms of Use(these “ **Terms**”), together with our website [Terms of Use](https://merge.dev/legal/terms) (the “ **TOU**”), govern use of the web-based tool currently known as “Blueprint,” as more fully defined below, made available by Merge API, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ **Merge**”).

‍

Merge reserves the right to modify or update these Terms in its sole discretion. The effective date of such updates and/or modifications will be the earlier of: (i) 30 days from the date of such update or modification; or (ii) Customer’s continued use of the Tool (as defined below).

‍

IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS AND THESE TERMS APPLY TO SUCH ENTITY WHICH IS DEEMED THE USER.

‍

1. **Tool**. Blueprint, including the software, infrastructure, and technology used to provide it (collectively, the “ **Tool**”) allows users to commence a process by which Merge may begin to create a new integration between its proprietary Software-as-a-Service integration solution for platforms (the “ **Service**”) and a third-party platform, which includes the normalization of the models and fields of the third-party platform (“ **Partner Models**”) to Merge’s standardized models and fields (known as “ **Common Models**”). Following submission of certain required information by a user, including, at the discretion of the user, the user’s email address (the “ **Input**”), the Tool will generate and display a set of preliminary relationships between the Partner Models and the Common Models (the “ **Output**”). The Tool is not part of the Service. Use of the Service is governed by the [Subscriber Agreement](https://merge.dev/legal/subscriber-agreement).
2. **Beta Feature**. The Tool is a beta feature and is not meant for commercial use. It may contain bugs, faults, errors, and defects and may produce inaccurate results or otherwise not work as intended. Merge may also discontinue providing the Tool or may take the functionality in-house.
3. **Limited Use License**. Subject to compliance with these Terms and the TOU, Merge grants you a limited, temporary, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense, during the Term (as defined below) to use the Tool solely for the purpose of determining preliminary compatibility between the Service and a partner platform. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Merge and its licensors. Nothing in these Terms is intended to grant any rights under any patent, copyright, or other intellectual property right of Merge.
4. **Restrictions**. In addition to the restrictions set forth in the TOU, you may not:

(a)

use the Tool other than as instructed by Merge;

(b)

submit any harmful or offensive content, or any content that you do not have the right to submit, via the Tool;

(c)

modify, create derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to gain access to the source code of, or copy the Tool or any of its components; or use the Tool to develop the same or similar items or directly or indirectly let any third party do so; or

(d)

circumvent or disable any security or other technological features of the Tool, or use the Tool in a manner that Merge reasonably believes poses a threat to the security of Merge-controlled computer systems.

5. **_Term_** _. As between you and Merge, these Terms will be in effect beginning as of when you (i) click a box indicating acceptance of these Terms or (ii) begin using the Tool, whichever comes first, and will end either (a) when the Tool delivers the Output, or (b) when Merge ceases to make the Tool publicly available, whichever comes first, unless otherwise terminated as provided herein (the “_ **_Term_** _”). Merge may terminate these Terms, and your access to or use of the Tool at any time in its sole discretion. The provisions of Sections 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (as applicable) will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms._
6. **_Feedback_** _. Comments, suggestions and recommendations that you provide to Merge with respect to the Tool or the Output are deemed “_ **_Feedback_** _” as that term is defined and used in the TOU._
7. **_Disclaimers_** _. The Tool merely conducts a test to determine compatibility between Partner Models and the Common Models and issues a preliminary result. It does not create a complete integration between the Service and a partner platform, and Merge may never build such an integration. Merge will determine whether to complete and release a requested integration in its sole discretion, including timing of such release and the ultimate functioning of the integration. The Output is provided AS-IS and without warranties or any kind. Merge assumes no liability for the Output or any use to which a you might put it._
8. **_Ownership_** _. As between you and Merge, Merge owns all intellectual property rights in and to the Tool and the Output. You represent and warrant to Merge that you have all rights necessary to submit the Input to Merge. Use of the Input by Merge is governed by these Terms, the TOU, and Merge’s Privacy Policy._
9. **_Miscellaneous_** _. These Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and assigns. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the state of California, without reference to conflicts of law rules. This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of these Terms. Any failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of that provision or of any other provision._
