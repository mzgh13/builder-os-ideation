Merge vs. Paragon

# Build once with Merge or build 200+ times with Paragon

‍

- With Merge’s Unified API, build just once to add 200+ product integrations; Paragon requires you to build each one separately
- Paragon places more burden on your engineers while Merge handles both maintenance and observability
- Access any data you need — Merge offers deeper data customization and extensibility than Paragon

## 01

### Paragon doesn’t solve the pain of building and maintaining every integration – Merge does

Paragon’s embedded iPaaS is unscalable; it requires you to individually build and maintain integrations for every single platform in their rigid, non-developer friendly tool.

With Merge, instantly scale your product integrations by accessing 200+ integrations across 6 key categories including HRIS, ticketing, and accounting.

#### With Merge

Build once to a Unified API

#### With Paragon

You build each integration 1 by 1, and building still requires engineers

## 02

### Merge supports the entire integration lifecycle while Paragon puts the burden on you

Merge maintains integrations, so you don't have to. Merge also offers observability tools like searchable logs and automated issue detection, enabling your support team to proactively resolve errors.

Paragon requires your engineering teams to monitor third-party API changes and to implement logic to catch and debug any issues.

## 03

### Paragon claims customization, but Merge actually delivers deeper, more extensible data

Anything that’s possible by building natively is possible through Merge. Read and write any custom objects and fields outside of our Merge’s Common Models.

Paragon only allows you to map fields in their low-code platform and places the responsibility on your customers; with Merge you have the flexibility to do it programmatically or in our dashboard.

#### How Bonusly built their HRIS integrations 20x faster using Merge instead of an Embedded iPaaS

[View case study\\
\\
Arrow Right](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/bonusly)

“Embedded iPaaS solutions require extensive customizations and force you to build one integration at a time, which isn’t scalable. With Merge, we can build once and access dozens of customizable HRIS integrations that are ready out-of-the-box.”
