@Merge

Choosing who to outsource customer-facing integrations to is critically important, as a poor decision can impact your customers, engineers, customer-facing teams, and, ultimately, your bottom line.

To help you decide if there are other product integration platforms worth using over Paragon, an [embedded iPaaS](https://www.merge.dev/blog/embedded-ipaas), we’ll introduce you to several alternative solutions and break down their respective pros and cons.

## **Merge**

Merge is a [unified API platform](https://www.merge.dev/blog/what-is-a-unified-api) that lets you add hundreds of integrations to your product through a single build. These integrations span several popular software categories, from CRM to HRIS to ATS to ticketing, allowing it to meet all of your integration needs.

[![How Merge works](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a95a7d5d7526d27f77feb4_6642538ec9d0264e62e85079_How%2520Merge%2520works.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a95a7d5d7526d27f77feb4_6642538ec9d0264e62e85079_How%2520Merge%2520works.webp)

#### **Top features**

- [Integration Observability features](https://www.merge.dev/features/integration-observability) for your customer-facing team, which include a dashboard, fully-searchable logs, and automated issue detection functionality

[![A screenshot of Merge's automated issue detection functionality](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65f8547883d3902fd54bd58e_Q28qNAEHxzETiYJcCdpsDSO5yf0M9m_IFUhuq9XgWvCYRaY3Agjba-JrRL1cDOY3DhorpeLGL8l5Shpgnr2z_MwQSAJITBjJwsfIX6lfqgGTm1cLwPZOovddu1J7ABYxcZo9usM0KbmBBQhBwoaErLs.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65f8547883d3902fd54bd58e_Q28qNAEHxzETiYJcCdpsDSO5yf0M9m_IFUhuq9XgWvCYRaY3Agjba-JrRL1cDOY3DhorpeLGL8l5Shpgnr2z_MwQSAJITBjJwsfIX6lfqgGTm1cLwPZOovddu1J7ABYxcZo9usM0KbmBBQhBwoaErLs.webp)

_Using Merge, your customer-facing team can easily pinpoint issues and the steps to resolve them_

- Advanced features to access custom objects and fields, which include [Field Mapping](https://docs.merge.dev/supplemental-data/field-mappings/overview/) and [Authenticated Passthrough Request](https://docs.merge.dev/supplemental-data/passthrough/overview/)

- Enterprise-grade security features, such [Audit Trail](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/8813877-merge-audit-trail-enhancing-security-compliance) and [Scopes](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/5950052-common-model-and-field-scopes)

#### **When to choose Merge over Paragon**

- **You need to take several integrations to market, quickly.** Since Paragon forces you to build one integration at a time, and Merge lets you build once to access all the integrations you need, Merge is significantly more effective at scaling your integration offerings

- **You want to access out-of-the-box features for managing integrations.** Unlike Merge, Paragon forces you to build custom logic to catch and debug errors

- **You don’t want your engineers using the platform beyond the initial integration build.** Paragon requires technical expertise to use, forcing your developers to build and manage every integration themselves. Merge, on the other hand, maintains the integrations on behalf of your engineers and enables your customer-facing employees to manage integrations via a no-code, intuitive UI

#### Don't settle for Paragon

Learn how Merge can help you build more reliable and secure customer-facing integrations at scale by scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts.

## **Finch**

Finch allows you to build once to its unified API to access HRIS and payroll integrations.

#### **Top features**

- Offers [“assisted integrations”](https://www.merge.dev/blog/automated-vs-assisted-integrations) to help scale their integration offerings

[![How Finch's assisted integrations work](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65fd9920d8b87069959414b1_LaNPLgLS2dN4DpUqZPw2rGE8OeCELUMFwX2xJmxGn6UMWLJ9d_xxcULkE5bGm-T5qC-U9D8BgPZ3VDqQZVZU2xZ1fETO8B1pKhMS4hiFRgoNBvi7q1rrrMdAzyT0vNU-GNootshDS9zjUpAhgtajDzk.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65fd9920d8b87069959414b1_LaNPLgLS2dN4DpUqZPw2rGE8OeCELUMFwX2xJmxGn6UMWLJ9d_xxcULkE5bGm-T5qC-U9D8BgPZ3VDqQZVZU2xZ1fETO8B1pKhMS4hiFRgoNBvi7q1rrrMdAzyT0vNU-GNootshDS9zjUpAhgtajDzk.webp)

_A look at how Finch’s assisted integrations work_

- In addition to “assisted integrations”, they provide API-based integrations

- Make sandboxes and SDKs available to help build and test connections

#### **When to choose Finch over Paragon**

- **You need to scale your HRIS and payroll integrations more easily.** You can build once to Finch’s Unified API to access numerous payroll and HRIS integrations

- **You’d like to provide a relatively easy onboarding experience.** Users can add an integration via Finch through a few relatively simple steps

## **Pandium**

Pandium offers an embedded iPaaS as well as an integration marketplace as a service.

#### **Top features**

- Lets you design, embed, and manage an in-app marketplace inside your application

- Offers an outsourcing service to help you launch and maintain integrations

[![Pandium's integration services](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6642532408bd4576b88b1af9_L_hUgiMC3oSvrvLqhG68OKdyD-87Rdb78RzEaTlHobB79ksTca5g1tpoJDopvjvvi_gUZpdiz9nGvRN80h2t5V7WGmUHC3qPGOAOdg7JOex4a7EKNYMVZSz9Wjc_ovydrzg6Z800o00EFQP0-bvWAG4.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6642532408bd4576b88b1af9_L_hUgiMC3oSvrvLqhG68OKdyD-87Rdb78RzEaTlHobB79ksTca5g1tpoJDopvjvvi_gUZpdiz9nGvRN80h2t5V7WGmUHC3qPGOAOdg7JOex4a7EKNYMVZSz9Wjc_ovydrzg6Z800o00EFQP0-bvWAG4.webp)

_Pandium markets their integration engineering service on their site. And while this service can be beneficial, it reveals that implementing and maintaining integrations on the platform can be technically complex_

- Allows you to [white label their in-app marketplace and integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/white-label-api-integration)

#### **When to choose Pandium over Paragon**

- **You’d like to outsource the development and maintenance of your in-app marketplace**

- **You don’t have the engineering resources to build and maintain integrations.** You can outsource this work to Pandium’s engineering service

- **You’d like to access key integration analytics.** The data can help you make the case for keeping your customer-facing integrations—if not also adding more

_Related:_ [_Building integrations versus buying them_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/build-vs-buy-integrations)

## **Workato**

Workato offers an embedded iPaaS, in addition to a traditional iPaaS, API management solution, among a few other solutions.

#### **Top features**

- Offers more than 1,200 pre-built connectors to help your team integrate applications faster and more easily

[![Workato's library of pre-built application connectors](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/664253242544eb83bdcf05fd_63miMEdkNC-ihu7-G36OLC7S6IyPZZG4RNPWXc2Ashrc-4dJEjuV2Zp8hr7RPMktxg62JlH0Gs3XID0luF-NC0eRiZAk_5T08NU_p1zOpkzTqE9JrSwSNRw7RfzHUsnn7cyYQsKEkRUv2pcdit0SUto.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/664253242544eb83bdcf05fd_63miMEdkNC-ihu7-G36OLC7S6IyPZZG4RNPWXc2Ashrc-4dJEjuV2Zp8hr7RPMktxg62JlH0Gs3XID0luF-NC0eRiZAk_5T08NU_p1zOpkzTqE9JrSwSNRw7RfzHUsnn7cyYQsKEkRUv2pcdit0SUto.webp)

_Workato offers a library of searchable, pre-built application connectors_

‍

- Supports Workbot®, a customizable platform bot for Slack and Microsoft Teams

- Provides copilots to help you build workflow automations faster

#### **When to choose Workato over Paragon**

- **You need to support more than customer-facing integrations.** If you’re also looking to build and manage internal integrations, API endpoints, and workflow applications, it can make sense to use Workato

- **You want to access a richer set of application connectors.** Since Workato supports a wider range of integrations and automations, it can probably better support your integration needs

- **You need an enterprise-grade embedded iPaaS.** Given their stronger track record of supporting enterprise organizations, Workato will likely do a better job of meeting your security and compliance requirements

## **Tray.io**

Tray.io is an embedded iPaaS solution, but, like Workato, it also provides additional integration and automation products. These include a traditional iPaaS and an API management solution.

#### **Top features**

- Provides hundreds of pre-built integrations and automation templates that support different teams and their use cases

- Powers Merlin AI, an autonomous agent that lets you build specific automations via a chat interface

[![Screenshot of Merlin AI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66425324a672dd9fb34e69fb_chfPvj8ZzYEvXNu3RuncpQAbM3NOD3hqYjb0qPMtjQwZT_LgdnR81uIeTNnV64CHvfK2AzP63d6WGsWzs3Stfj4TNuxXetDpp6MGgPwihHQS_KGAFiiFDycB7bCPOboxB0qu2vROvDxGmUZ08-QtvmY.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66425324a672dd9fb34e69fb_chfPvj8ZzYEvXNu3RuncpQAbM3NOD3hqYjb0qPMtjQwZT_LgdnR81uIeTNnV64CHvfK2AzP63d6WGsWzs3Stfj4TNuxXetDpp6MGgPwihHQS_KGAFiiFDycB7bCPOboxB0qu2vROvDxGmUZ08-QtvmY.webp)

_Merlin AI, while still in its infancy, may be able to help you build internal workflow automations across your internal applications through written instructions_

- An API management solution that lets you design and manage API endpoints

#### **When to choose Tray.io over Paragon**

- **Your** [**integration requirements**](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-requirements) **extend beyond product integrations.** The solution can also help you build and maintain API endpoints and supports internal integrations use cases

- **You want to build automations through plain text.** While Merlin AI is still relatively new and may come with significant limitations, it can—in certain cases—help you build automations significantly faster by allowing you to simply use plain text to describe what you want

- **You’d like to validate your use cases through case studies.** Tray.io has a more comprehensive library of case studies than Paragon, so there’s naturally a higher chance that they’ll provide more relevant case studies

## **Nango**

Nango offers an open-source unified API solution that lets clients add customer-facing integrations that span several software categories.

[![A snapshot of the integration categories Nango supports](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a95753070b43418d86e1dc_AD_4nXfdD03BneI8IfSA7Pspm1rsgFTdJho7tu3FpQqTqY1TZlCeOc5Kxl5CE3VSLD_7SBIv4s901p_jfJE3ouh3WNw7tn4CyM-83h_Le_rcsAj2FPBxLYkMlu3HPB9s9Q8B0wv8HRZzzKCYHK0fFHWYkVUNrHKt.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a95753070b43418d86e1dc_AD_4nXfdD03BneI8IfSA7Pspm1rsgFTdJho7tu3FpQqTqY1TZlCeOc5Kxl5CE3VSLD_7SBIv4s901p_jfJE3ouh3WNw7tn4CyM-83h_Le_rcsAj2FPBxLYkMlu3HPB9s9Q8B0wv8HRZzzKCYHK0fFHWYkVUNrHKt.webp)

_A look at some of the integration categories Nango supports_

#### **Top features**

- Covers 10+ unified API categories, which include e-commerce, file storage, accounting, and ticketing

- Open-sourced their platform, allowing engineers outside of the company to contribute (e.g., adding an integration to Nango’s unified API)

- Complies with GDPR and SOC 2 Type II

#### **When to choose Nango over Paragon**

- You want to integrate with specific applications that Nango supports and that Paragon doesn’t provide pre-built connectors for; this includes Gmail, Ramp, Brex, Figma, among a few others

- You want to invest in a platform that your team can help improve over time

## **Zapier** ‍

Zapier is a workflow automation tool that lets users build “zaps”, or task-based automations, that work across applications.

#### **Top features**

- Provides AI templates that leverage machine learning models, like GPT-4, enabling you to build intelligent automations quickly

- Offers Tables that let you consolidate data and link data to specific automations

- Enables you to build custom solutions for your application or site that’s powered by zaps (i.e., Interfaces)

[![An example of Zapier Interfaces](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a9575395ea61a2b4916cac_AD_4nXe--eSUApWIQkePrf78YxW-uT6T-1QvinOTIieRq2DBXqCRxRMd_yYqcqlZxzIfLsfoT2JtEYUsqLrwKBd3DrActVhOIPU0UdTh3e5AMQvbuYWUz-_D8kZwVlydi7-8B0iLRUEeISKJJym2ElXI1B4-VpfZ.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66a9575395ea61a2b4916cac_AD_4nXe--eSUApWIQkePrf78YxW-uT6T-1QvinOTIieRq2DBXqCRxRMd_yYqcqlZxzIfLsfoT2JtEYUsqLrwKBd3DrActVhOIPU0UdTh3e5AMQvbuYWUz-_D8kZwVlydi7-8B0iLRUEeISKJJym2ElXI1B4-VpfZ.webp)

_Interfaces allows you to build custom solutions, like a contact form for your application, that’s powered by zaps_

#### **When to choose Zapier over Paragon**

- You’re primarily looking to implement internal integrations

- You want to invest in an integration solution that’s been in the market significantly longer and has proven success with a diverse set of customers

- You don’t want your engineers involved in building and maintaining integrations and automations at any stage

## Final thoughts

When it comes to evaluating and selecting a vendor for customer-facing integrations, you likely have several criteria in mind. This can be whether the integration vendor meets your security requirements—and that of your customers; the breadth and depth of integrations the provider supports; how quickly it allows you to scale your integrations—and so on.

Paragon may check off some of these requirements, but Merge likely meets more—if not all—of them, making our solution a better long-term integration partner for your business.

You can learn more about how we compare to Paragon by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fparagon-alternatives).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
