A year and a half ago, we founded Merge to solve the [integrations problem 10x](https://www.merge.dev/blog/company/why-we-started-merge-) better than any product trying to do the same. Now, just six months out of stealth, we’ve seen our users grow from 100 to over 600. That 500% increase is a tremendous vote of confidence from you: leaders, developers, and teams who are just as tired of dealing with integrations as we were.

Today, we’re excited to announce our $15 million Series A led by Addition. This round allows us to commit to growing not just our product and team, but a critical part of our business: partnerships. With this round, we’re continuing on our mission to revolutionize how every B2B company approaches its integrations strategy.

## Product + Team Expansion

We've experienced some amazing growth since we announced our Seed round with [**NEA**](https://www.merge.dev/blog/company/announcing-merge%E2%80%99s-$4.5m-seed-round-and-accounting-api?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=series-a-announcement) in May. Here are some of the highlights:

- Product features released include better logs, enhanced webhooks, CSV upload, SAML SSO, and our [**single-tenant offering**](https://www.merge.dev/blog/engineering/announcing-single-tenancy-at-merge?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=series-a-announcement)
- Our new [Platform team](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product/what-is-a-unified-api?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=series-a-announcement) built out integrations for platforms like Oracle Taleo, Jobvite, and Workday HRIS — you can learn about their endpoints and more through our revamped [documentation](https://www.merge.dev/blog/design/designing-docs-for-merge's-unified-api?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=series-a-announcement)
- We’ve grown our team to 20 people (and counting!). Weexpanded our executive team

## From Payroll APIs to Accounting APIs: Why We’re Serious About Partnerships

On top of our product and team growth, we're also thrilled to announce our brand new partnerships with [BambooHR](https://www.bamboohr.com/) and [Lever](https://www.lever.co/).

For our current and future customers, partnerships ensure reliable integrations with some of the most popular HR, payroll, recruiting, and accounting products on the market. For API providers, partnerships ensure their products are not just the source of truth, but that they become the foundation on top of which Merge's customers build.

Building off of our previous partnerships with HR and payroll API providers like [UKG](https://www.merge.dev/blog/company/announcing-merge's-partnership-with-ukg?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=site&utm_campaign=series-a-announcement), we couldn’t be more proud to partner with leaders like BambooHR and Lever.

"We're so excited to announce this partnership with Merge! This partnership will help our customers easily sync their BambooHR data with a wider-array of third-party vendors who have already integrated with Merge, and will continue to help expand the developer ecosystem around our product." - _Natalie Bigney, BambooHR Marketplace Manage_ r

In addition to partnerships, this round enables us to continue expanding our integrations with HR APIs, payroll APIs, recruiting APIs, and accounting APIs. In the coming months, we’ll increase the headcount of our sales and engineering teams, as well as further boost our marketing efforts. Merge customers can also look forward to enterprise features like on-premise support and audit trails!

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
