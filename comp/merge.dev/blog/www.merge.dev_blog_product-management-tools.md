@Merge

As a product manager, you likely own a broad scope of work, from developing and managing roadmaps to running market and user research to analyzing feature adoption and iterating based on gleaned insights.

Given everything on your plate, you’ll likely need a large and constantly evolving set of tools to help execute on your goals.

We’ll break down the current list of tools worth leveraging, but let’s start by aligning on what product management tools look like in 2025.

## **What are product management tools?**

A product management tool is any software that can help a PM build, launch, iterate, or scale a product or an aspect of a product, such as an integration, a security measure, or an AI feature.

[![Overview of product management tools](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d7b3306ecba6cbb810_AD_4nXcAFHEZw7pPiEQBkihzfYu0q7UjxJxzhr2kBc0RsQe8jdoOfyMhzurqBg-CjazoxCRGYa4eanzrqk4ksUTL6pbXzNPFfdAIu585xhF_CSfmILqLWzU3vLl07h81X4A_e27_H72_bA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d7b3306ecba6cbb810_AD_4nXcAFHEZw7pPiEQBkihzfYu0q7UjxJxzhr2kBc0RsQe8jdoOfyMhzurqBg-CjazoxCRGYa4eanzrqk4ksUTL6pbXzNPFfdAIu585xhF_CSfmILqLWzU3vLl07h81X4A_e27_H72_bA.png)

_A snapshot of popular product management software categories and tools. Many of these tools fall into multiple categories_

_Related:_ [_What is an AI product strategy? Plus, how to implement one effectively_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy)

## **Core categories of product management tools**

Let’s take a closer look at the popular categories.

- **Roadmapping and strategy:** These tools let you develop and edit your [product roadmaps](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-roadmap-examples) across product lines and features. They also often include project management functionality (and if they don’t, they integrate with project management tools) to ensure key tasks get assigned and executed on time

- **User research and feedback:** You can use these tools to survey users within your product to gather timely, contextual feedback, see how users interact with your product organically, gather hard-to-reach panels and ask them questions related to your current or planned products or features

- **Collaboration and documentation:** These tools allow you to highlight the features and/or products you’re building, how you’re implementing them, your plans for building them, and more. You can also use these tools to lay out key cross-functional processes, such as how sprints are performed

Whatever you end up adding to these platforms should be visible to cross-functional partners and offer them the chance to make comments, perform edits, and add their own notes.

- **Analytics and product intelligence:** You can leverage these platforms to understand if and how users interact with certain product features, which can help you pinpoint opportunities—if any—for improvement. These platforms also allow you to perform more robust analysis on certain features’ functionality by letting you perform A/B tests, segment your analysis by a specific cohort, and more

- **Collaboration & Documentation:** These solutions allow you to lay out product specs, [craft product objectives](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-objectives) for certain initiatives, work with design on landing pages, and much more. Essentially, these tools are where you align with cross-functional teams on your product strategy and work with them on specific tasks that fall under your product roadmap


- **Integration and API Management:** The former type of solution lets you add integrations to your product more easily and can support your team in maintaining them, while the latter lets you manage your product’s API endpoints. In short, they serve different integration use cases but both allow you to support integrations with your product
- **AI:** The AI solutions for product managers is fast-evolving, but it includes a combination of mainstream [AI chatbots](https://www.merge.dev/blog/how-to-build-ai-chatbot), like ChatGPT, and AI features and functionality that’s included in tools within our other categories. For example, a tool within analytics and product intelligence can use AI to provide product managers with intelligent predictions on whether a certain feature change will influence a usage metric

## **The best product management tools**

Based on all the categories above, there are countless tools available for your team. To help you trim down your list, here are some that stand out in their respective categories.

### **Miro**

Miro is a digital collaboration platform that can help your product team outline feature specs, project manage specific tasks, define specific user flows, and more.

The platform has nearly 8,000 reviews on [their G2 listing](https://www.g2.com/products/miro/reviews) with a 4.5 star rating, and they’re the leader in the [G2 Grid® for Strategy and Innovation Roadmapping Tools](https://www.g2.com/categories/strategy-and-innovation-roadmapping-tools#grid).

## **How to select the right tools for your team**

Given all the tools available, the process of evaluating and selecting the best ones for your organization can be daunting.

To help you navigate this exercise successfully, here are a few steps you can take.

[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d674e270c5199f2359_AD_4nXfHT21MPtT-OeKbm7Xrt7P1RGFa7oTq2iyh4kJ7Zsy1d2KkIXghzuDezywPAg4aab16vf1UHsAVrCo-11W9uvmKAeWacmd8vnzEjS-l-jNEOnkkqLHtnfw2eH3X3bEjUX1B7sLt.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6818d2d674e270c5199f2359_AD_4nXfHT21MPtT-OeKbm7Xrt7P1RGFa7oTq2iyh4kJ7Zsy1d2KkIXghzuDezywPAg4aab16vf1UHsAVrCo-11W9uvmKAeWacmd8vnzEjS-l-jNEOnkkqLHtnfw2eH3X3bEjUX1B7sLt.png)

_You can follow the steps above any time your team needs a certain type of tool_

### **Define your objective**

This step is obvious but it’s critical in not only narrowing down the category of tooling you need but also the particular tools you should look at.

Here are just some examples of goals you can adopt:

- **Monitor product usage metrics that allow us to accurately assess a given feature’s performance— and improve upon it—over time.** You can also define the metrics you care about, like feature engagement count and feature use frequency, to help you pin down the product analytics tools that track these metrics


- **Integrate with the 10 most requested ticketing solutions and file storage applications.** This lets you whittle down the integration solutions by those that support these integrations

Your goal can also help inform your Request for Proposal (RFP) document, which will be critical at later stages of this process.

[![How to build a product experience (PX) strategy in 2025](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67d857c228f210c3289347ec_Blog%20Header%20Brand%20Refresh%20(5).png)](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-experience-strategy?blog-related=image)

### **Define requirements based on team maturity**

Once you know the type of tool you need and are able to narrow down your list, you should reflect on the specific PMs on your team who’d use them and ask yourself the following:

- How technical are they?
- How specialized are their roles?
- How much capacity do they have?

The answers to these questions can help you better suss out the features your team will actually use and need now and which aren’t as appropriate (at least for the time being). You can also gather direct feedback from your team to pressure test your hypotheses.

### **Compare features, integrations, and support**

Based on the RFP you put together, you can directly compare the solutions’ with one another along the criteria that matters most.

If possible, you should also participate in free trials with each solution to validate that their features and integrations work as advertised and that their support team is responsive and helpful. Based on this hands-on experience, you’ll likely know which solution is the best one for your team.

### **Pilot and validate internally**

Finally, you should select a tool for a proof of concept to actually execute on your use cases. As part of this process, you should negotiate an out-clause in case the tool ultimately proves to be a bad fit.

Assuming it works—and it likely will, given all the steps you followed—it’ll be a key tool in your product team’s tech stack.

### **Final thoughts**

Given that your product team’s responsibilities have likely grown over time, you’ll need to adopt a broad set of tools to empower them.

If you can follow the steps above to identify and invest in best-in-class tooling across the board, you’re giving your team, and by extension your product, a competitive advantage in the years to come.
