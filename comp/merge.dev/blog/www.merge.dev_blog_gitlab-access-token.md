GitLab, a devops lifecycle tool, helps companies manage issues and code repositories as well as deploy software solutions.

While the platform’s out-of-the-box features and capabilities are already powerful, they can provide even more value when you integrate the platform to your other internal applications or when you connect your product to customers' instances of the application.

Regardless of your integration use case(s) with GitLab, you’ll need to create a unique access token in the platform. We’ll help you do just that below!

### **1\. Sign in or invest in one of their plans**

You’ll either need to sign in or get started on one of their plans. You can also start a free 30-day trial.

### **2\. Click on the green icon and then select “Preferences"**

Once you’re logged in, you should see a green icon on the top left-hand corner. Once you click this, you should see “Preferences” in the dropdown. You can go ahead and select it.

[![Navigating to GitLab's "Preferences" section](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2abb2220529d4d4c29d_pNOriNSWHJ_8pTBPfvEZ8X_Peyings1xeMxwKlt5TPq6raWnsvcLIsDJs0gqfQIqFPQd6-m4qaqIMGoBm3oLwgMelqtMvtq_nyVK9z39xU0NorE_5cnzBrrLmZ1oNcHDCA2eBtGkPMisq_uGiO07dMs.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2abb2220529d4d4c29d_pNOriNSWHJ_8pTBPfvEZ8X_Peyings1xeMxwKlt5TPq6raWnsvcLIsDJs0gqfQIqFPQd6-m4qaqIMGoBm3oLwgMelqtMvtq_nyVK9z39xU0NorE_5cnzBrrLmZ1oNcHDCA2eBtGkPMisq_uGiO07dMs.webp)

### **3\. Select “Access Tokens” on the left-hand menu**

You should see “Access Tokens” on the left side of your screen. Once you click it, you’ll land on the page for generating your personal access token.

[![Where Access Token appears in GitLab](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66c789df07c894af032f9b42_661ed7e4e408584e9006a917_Screenshot%25202024-04-16%2520at%25203.55.09%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66c789df07c894af032f9b42_661ed7e4e408584e9006a917_Screenshot%25202024-04-16%2520at%25203.55.09%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)

### **4\. Click “Add new token”**

You should now see a button that says “Add new token.” Once you hit this you should land on a page that allows you to create your personal access token.

[![Adding a new token in GitLab](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a975277c2470dd0b70_jiMEE1-ra3s23fOrenDbxcc_EKYTuHyg1LTlUsFNee11zOMds7iY5utu12brFzHl_lGku5rPxKQH3lzJ5YJx3gI6LIgZfpSGj48ib1fYw1jt0FSFk-kbZe2bh2-od4_fzcVwr1n9aSshC4eSKv7iaK0.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a975277c2470dd0b70_jiMEE1-ra3s23fOrenDbxcc_EKYTuHyg1LTlUsFNee11zOMds7iY5utu12brFzHl_lGku5rPxKQH3lzJ5YJx3gI6LIgZfpSGj48ib1fYw1jt0FSFk-kbZe2bh2-od4_fzcVwr1n9aSshC4eSKv7iaK0.webp)

### **5\. Choose the scopes for your token**

You can now give your token a name, select its expiration date, and pick the specific permission levels you want it to have. In other words, you’ll determine the set of actions that can be performed on specific resources in GitLab once an API call is authenticated with the token.

Once you’ve finished making your selections, you can click “Create personal access token.”

[![Selecting the token's scopes and then creating it](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a9d7c44f0a44a3d4c1_ybjLqcEt6Kydkx61ds0KyZCO4-UdCrb4qFmzhyU5LcedZmyUKNGc8IBQk00kH9dDvn7i_7ytSHUKiGie6DwTOdaK6suSOmsM2a8-c5dlmzjtBNHdfaqXQ5dYW8yowbUz7zf7TT0ELicbmUSwekUkMow.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a9d7c44f0a44a3d4c1_ybjLqcEt6Kydkx61ds0KyZCO4-UdCrb4qFmzhyU5LcedZmyUKNGc8IBQk00kH9dDvn7i_7ytSHUKiGie6DwTOdaK6suSOmsM2a8-c5dlmzjtBNHdfaqXQ5dYW8yowbUz7zf7TT0ELicbmUSwekUkMow.webp)

### **Other considerations for building to GitLab’s API**

Before building to GitLab’s API, you should look into and understand the following areas:

#### **Pricing**

GitLab offers 3 plans: “Free”, “Premium”, and “Ultimate.”

[![GitLab's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a91948ef9544fc0ad9_HwYUcyYNDPP53jCFe40Sga-cYJx0NA23ghqxtkhfhxkEHaon7n44wDsBmAO0qyTtAv3Ib4KNAy73mZ4tYRn2zWowI72jwcqLhD6MJQbTaNvY_Gz7iWJAhCXIXpu3MS8kqQ5UFUG2IXYfJE8RRHg9Wx4.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/661ed2a91948ef9544fc0ad9_HwYUcyYNDPP53jCFe40Sga-cYJx0NA23ghqxtkhfhxkEHaon7n44wDsBmAO0qyTtAv3Ib4KNAy73mZ4tYRn2zWowI72jwcqLhD6MJQbTaNvY_Gz7iWJAhCXIXpu3MS8kqQ5UFUG2IXYfJE8RRHg9Wx4.webp)

As you move up their pricing tiers, you’ll get additional storage, access to more advanced features for managing users’ access levels, security dashboards, and more.

_Learn more about_ [_GitLab’s price plans_](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) _._

#### **Rate limits**

GitLab has both configurable and non-configurable rate limits.

Configurable rate limits allow an admin to set the specific rate limit policies for certain resources and/or requestors (e.g., user and IP rate limits). Non-configurable rate limits, on the other hand, are specific endpoints that have defined rate limit policies that all API consumers need to abide by.

_Learn more about_ [_GitLab’s configurable and non-configurable rate limits_](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/rate_limits.html) _._

#### **Errors to look out for**

You can receive a wide range of errors for different reasons. Here’s a look at a few of them:

- **401 Unauthorized:** The token is expired, invalid, or missing, so the request can’t be carried out successfully **‍**
- **403 Forbidden:** The token is valid but it doesn’t have the appropriate level of permissions to carry out the request **‍**
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource doesn’t exist **‍**
- **429 Too Many Requests:** A user has sent too many requests in a given rate limit window **‍**
- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server underwent a specific, unforeseen condition that prevented it from handling the request successfully

### **Final thoughts**

[GitLab](https://www.merge.dev/integrations/gitlab) is a popular ticketing solution, but it isn’t the only one your clients use. They may also be using ticketing tools like Asana, Trello, or GitHub.

You can offer integrations with any of the tickets solutions your clients have by building to [Merge’s Ticketing Unified API](https://www.merge.dev/categories/ticketing-api).

To learn more about the unified API, and Merge’s platform more broadly, you can [schedule a demo](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fgitlab-access-token) with one of our integration experts!

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
