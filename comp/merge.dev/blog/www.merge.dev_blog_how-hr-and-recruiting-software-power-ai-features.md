As HR software solutions look to build AI features that differentiate their platforms and delight customers, they’ll need to decide on the data they use to power their machine learning models.

We’ll break down why customer-facing integrations provide the best source of data for any HR software platform by highlighting 3 real-world examples.

## **Assembly offers an intelligent intranet solution**

Assembly offers an AI Workplace Assistant (which they also refer to as “DoraAI”) that enables their customers’ employees to get any company-related questions answered quickly and accurately.

Employees can even access resources that support DoraAI’s output, allowing employees to learn further and have confidence in the AI assistant’s response.

For example, an employee can ask, “What is my PTO policy?” and DoraAI can not only answer the question in a few sentences but also include the employer’s leave policy PDF as a source.

[![Screenshot of DoraAI answering a question](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6626d06c30118eb4bb5e1f06_AOnz7hAdeM4W7L7C9XYQNyRXSnuxW4HcEkioP5ORZak-L333eQ7666N1htA0s85jxL8QRkNerXGaz1EF9AHwuXPwmdYAfN-nDgI_6SOGZprVeLU-5m2f3Vj4vxp8lpd3UMts86dmN4IPltkLZ9s3x_E.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6626d06c30118eb4bb5e1f06_AOnz7hAdeM4W7L7C9XYQNyRXSnuxW4HcEkioP5ORZak-L333eQ7666N1htA0s85jxL8QRkNerXGaz1EF9AHwuXPwmdYAfN-nDgI_6SOGZprVeLU-5m2f3Vj4vxp8lpd3UMts86dmN4IPltkLZ9s3x_E.webp)

_DoraAI uses information from clients’ files in Assembly when generating responses_

To power this functionality, a customer can integrate their file storage solution with Assembly—whether that’s Box, DropBox, SharePoint, etc. Once integrated, DoraAI can initially—and then continually—ingest the documents in the integrated file storage solution.

Jonathan Fields, Assembly’s CEO and co-founder, shares more on why they decided to use customer-facing integrations—and Merge—to support DoraAI:

## **Fetcher consistently recommends high-fit candidates**

Fetcher offers an AI solution that helps recruiters identify target candidates for certain roles.

[![Screenshot of a candidate recommendation from Fetcher ](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6760711bb56d4e34b5b78e68_AD_4nXdDcoXUYKV0Daa8oOM-mf4fuFwoGcu5MVBCyApCRj588tos5J9SzacnDTnMV6FubLTDP39yy5vFBuoQ4Us-BBJNq0lJc5yXJNVuujLcYkB6QkYQSviEtoR41YjH9_x9q7UiIvxlHg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6760711bb56d4e34b5b78e68_AD_4nXdDcoXUYKV0Daa8oOM-mf4fuFwoGcu5MVBCyApCRj588tos5J9SzacnDTnMV6FubLTDP39yy5vFBuoQ4Us-BBJNq0lJc5yXJNVuujLcYkB6QkYQSviEtoR41YjH9_x9q7UiIvxlHg.webp)

_Recruiters can not only receive candidates but also easily learn about them and follow-up with each one_

To help their ML model continually learn about the qualities that make for strong candidates for a given customer and open role (which, in turn, improves their recommendations), Fetcher continuously feeds the data from a customer’s ATS—candidate’s status, employer, job title, etc.—to their ML model.

_Related:_ [_Why fetcher migrated all of their in-house ATS integrations to Merge_](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/fetcher)

## **BrightHire helps recruiters assess interviewers** ‍

BrightHire uses an AI copilot that can—among other things—identify the key skills and competencies for a given role. The AI copilot then summarizes the topics covered in interview loops, which includes insights on the critical skills and/or topic areas that were and weren't covered for a specific candidate (or all of the candidates for an open role).

[![How BrightHire analyzes interviewers' skills coverage for a given open role](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/676adeb7b2c422594e0572be_676ade918ded1fae35fd5c5f_image4.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/676adeb7b2c422594e0572be_676ade918ded1fae35fd5c5f_image4.webp)

Integration data is the backbone of this functionality, as the copilot leverages the job descriptions from customers' ATSs to pinpoint the top skills and competencies across roles.
