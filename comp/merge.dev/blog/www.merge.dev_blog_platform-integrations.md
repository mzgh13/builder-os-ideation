A platform integration solution can play a critical role in keeping software applications in sync and in automating key business processes.

To help you build impactful integrations at scale, we’ll break down effective use cases and the platform integration tools you can use to build them.

But first, let’s align on the definition of a platform integration and breakdown how they typically work.

## **Platform integration definition**

A platform integration, otherwise known as an integration platform, is a 3rd-party tool that helps your team build and maintain integrations, typically via application programming interfaces (APIs).

In addition, these platforms can either help you build internal integrations (i.e., integrations between the applications your organization uses) or customer-facing integrations (i.e., integrations between your product and your customers’ applications).

[![Types of platform integration](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654d3417732269637a6db028_CiPjiqmc7lLwnVsLAXWqGFBuODDUO27N4WuinwV57WXD8UwD63F8metLAcEUH_41NEwoWU1zx936k-tTDvb62O9-OsXNSlIInlvqztNvc0S71LMiggqYUlyH5jSGrLBjAqBh2j4g3HyCdZ17B59KAw0.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654d3417732269637a6db028_CiPjiqmc7lLwnVsLAXWqGFBuODDUO27N4WuinwV57WXD8UwD63F8metLAcEUH_41NEwoWU1zx936k-tTDvb62O9-OsXNSlIInlvqztNvc0S71LMiggqYUlyH5jSGrLBjAqBh2j4g3HyCdZ17B59KAw0.webp)

_Platform integrations can either be internal (right) or customer-facing (left)_

Common internal integration platforms include Mulesoft, Zapier, Informatica, and Boomi, while popular customer-facing integration platforms include Merge, Workato, and Tray.ai.

[![Common unified API and embedded iPaaS vendors](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679bd128314901af92184119_AD_4nXcsTWNEOmZ4pECt01MCtz40dG0AOCtm7HFAE4mhvn_akpniVyzEyFQ90krvUeiZGXvT1EbnH2Sy8XJoGTeRLFyenhn4YGcws3GajiquTQu5WzoC8vg_9d4h8HyoHEeRS391Uwfydw.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679bd128314901af92184119_AD_4nXcsTWNEOmZ4pECt01MCtz40dG0AOCtm7HFAE4mhvn_akpniVyzEyFQ90krvUeiZGXvT1EbnH2Sy8XJoGTeRLFyenhn4YGcws3GajiquTQu5WzoC8vg_9d4h8HyoHEeRS391Uwfydw.webp)

_There’s a wide range of customer-facing integration platforms across two software categories—embedded iPaaS and unified API_

_Related:_ [_API connection overview_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connection)

## **How integration platforms work**

While integration platforms often differ in meaningful ways, they generally support the following:

- **API-based connectivity:** You can build once to a unified API to access a whole category of API-based integrations or access [pre-built API connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector) to integrate with individual applications faster


- **Workflow automations:** Many integration platforms offer a workflow UI that lets you create triggers and actions that work across applications, data, and teams. For example, a trigger can be any time a new lead comes into your CRM, and one of the actions can be messaging the relevant sales rep in an app like Slack

- **Integration observability:** Most integration platforms offer some form of logging to help you see all of the API requests and responses and troubleshoot potential issues. Some platforms may even diagnose the issues and provide the steps for addressing them, accelerating your team’s time to resolution


- **Centralized governance:** You can decide who can build, modify, and/or monitor certain integrations and workflow automations. You might also be able to leverage features that audit users’ activities in the integration platform to ensure that the appropriate governance measures are in place


- **Enterprise-grade security:** Integration platforms often take the necessary measures to comply with GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2, and more to keep your internal and/or customer data secure and to foster trust with customers and prospects. Some platforms even offer features that let you pick and choose the data you can and can’t sync for a given system


- **Customizability:** While integration platforms often provide fairly deep integrations out of the box, they may offer features to accommodate unique and unexpected use cases. For example, a unified API platform can let you add additional fields to their normalized data models

## **Examples of using integration platforms**

To help make our definition more tangible, let’s break down a few popular use cases for internal integration platforms and then share a couple of impactful customer-facing integrations.

#### **Enable finance to reconcile payroll expenses and close the books faster**

To help your finance team access payroll-related expenses quickly, easily, and without any issues, you can integrate your payroll solution with your ERP system and build a flow that works as follows: following each payroll run, your payroll system automatically POSTs payroll journal entries to your ERP system.

#### **Empower your business analysts to make critical financial decisions**

To help your business analysts make timely, informed, and critical decisions over time, they’ll need access to the most recent financial data in the application they use for analysis—a business intelligence (BI) solution.

To help facilitate this, you can connect your ERP system with your BI solution and sync fields, like invoices, on a specific cadence (e.g., every 24 hours).

[![Sync between Xero and Tableau](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/666c84fa32888dad8b7da954_AD_4nXfj-Q_QQetNBOfUJmqGHhpyEZtpKYkNcHaHhlfIl0hkC7oOD7GxqWpKAr_Cgr1KUSCj9wT39eJnuyUWuclNRenTzN_tUMDsc-E_bI-7rsqQaP23yvzGCEyeel297BOHF7ZVT3RqAUdmCr-bwdlxY-aabcis.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/666c84fa32888dad8b7da954_AD_4nXfj-Q_QQetNBOfUJmqGHhpyEZtpKYkNcHaHhlfIl0hkC7oOD7GxqWpKAr_Cgr1KUSCj9wT39eJnuyUWuclNRenTzN_tUMDsc-E_bI-7rsqQaP23yvzGCEyeel297BOHF7ZVT3RqAUdmCr-bwdlxY-aabcis.webp)

_Related:_ [_Examples of API integration_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-integration-examples)

#### **Automate user provisioning**

To help your customers add users to and remove users from your product with ease, you can connect with their HRIS solutions and implement the following flows:

- Once a customer adds an employee to their integrated HRIS, that employee is automatically available to add in the customer’s instance of your platform. Moreover, they can be provisioned with a certain level of permissions by default based on their role, department, location, etc.

[![How BILL Spend & Expense users can add employees from their HRIS ](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66aa7bb6a7ce4772855ea446_66708f363878467523ad7655_AD_4nXfcX3sDAA1t1-dPMmvzRjHpNfeaHmNE5mlyGkmGcgDkcyYWGRF_k-bMCKabfqr9xc0cpqC1qVEegYtJ-Az0x3NijCMxPsX2-eOaofARLO4UyQx1DzwzK7RRGjpq-tRpnxYZIXv1DhRaXS41ea5aK0xolAHH.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66aa7bb6a7ce4772855ea446_66708f363878467523ad7655_AD_4nXfcX3sDAA1t1-dPMmvzRjHpNfeaHmNE5mlyGkmGcgDkcyYWGRF_k-bMCKabfqr9xc0cpqC1qVEegYtJ-Az0x3NijCMxPsX2-eOaofARLO4UyQx1DzwzK7RRGjpq-tRpnxYZIXv1DhRaXS41ea5aK0xolAHH.webp)

_BILL implemented an auto-provisioning flow that lets admin users find and add users that were recently added in the integrated HRIS_

- Once a customer removes an employee from the integrated HRIS, an admin at that customer account gets notified in your product and can go on to remove them with the click of a button

[![How BILL Spend & Expense users can deprovision users once they're removed or marked as terminated in the connected HRIS](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66aa7bb6a7ce4772855ea44e_66708f36e85cd7fe7ce8373b_AD_4nXeYql95y2xOnwwNHccfxXzPudpaCXFViav0_CNtBF2vovxXLQ863qjxGMxvnBRd9VxJ9YNDgI0E97aGwQ27-BWK7RBGHshxh71e5WeOnr8u1lGO0gujWzIkCsGyXEykWUQc4NZtOjdQkHzJczAyPd05oLXK.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66aa7bb6a7ce4772855ea44e_66708f36e85cd7fe7ce8373b_AD_4nXeYql95y2xOnwwNHccfxXzPudpaCXFViav0_CNtBF2vovxXLQ863qjxGMxvnBRd9VxJ9YNDgI0E97aGwQ27-BWK7RBGHshxh71e5WeOnr8u1lGO0gujWzIkCsGyXEykWUQc4NZtOjdQkHzJczAyPd05oLXK.webp)

_BILL also implemented an auto-deprovisioning flow that notifies admin users when employees are removed in the HRIS solution and provides the option to remove them with the click of a button_

_Related:_ [_A guide to automated provisioning_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/automated-provisioning)

## **Types of integration platforms**

There are a wide range of integration platforms that support either internal or customer-facing use cases.

That said, the former (internal integration platforms) generally include two types of solutions:

- **Integration platform as a service (iPaaS):** helps you develop API-based integrations and build workflow automations that work across them. They also typically offer thousands of [API connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector) and hundreds of thousands of automation templates to accelerate adoption, along with additional solutions and services, like an API management platform

Common iPaaS solutions include Mulesoft, Boomi, Jitterbit, and Zapier

- **Robotic process automation (RPA) software:** lets you build custom software scripts (i.e., bots) that can mimic human tasks at the UI-level, such as copying and pasting data between applications. Popular vendors include UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism

The latter (customer-facing integrations) are also dominated by two types of solutions:

- **Unified API:** enables you to add hundreds of integrations to your product through a single, aggregated API (i.e., a unified API). [Unified API solutions](https://www.merge.dev/blog/what-is-a-unified-api) often specialize in specific software categories (though not always) and provide varying features and support when it comes to managing and maintaining your integrations

[![Unified API visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575dedee48e8283072a0d8_AD_4nXejS__RX_3Uuc9YpuKeXRxGc4zfM39qwp6nB20vRUluK9dctZiAF4ozQqQbL5gOfX4y6men2SQoUmJlc3bs6MamyRMEpbJvYkfpxFRBZhqL3-3jDO4L7TCisGqD4kJ3O4YSCE4GCg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575dedee48e8283072a0d8_AD_4nXejS__RX_3Uuc9YpuKeXRxGc4zfM39qwp6nB20vRUluK9dctZiAF4ozQqQbL5gOfX4y6men2SQoUmJlc3bs6MamyRMEpbJvYkfpxFRBZhqL3-3jDO4L7TCisGqD4kJ3O4YSCE4GCg.webp)

‍

As you evaluate tools in the market, you’ll likely come across Merge, Finch, Codat, and Apideck

- **Embedded iPaaS:** empowers you to add one integration at a time to your product. It also offers a workflow builder (like a traditional iPaaS) that lets customers implement workflow automations between your product and the integrated application(s)

Also, depending on the [embedded iPaaS vendor](https://www.merge.dev/blog/embedded-ipaas), you may be able to implement the solution in ways that either give customers more or less control over their integrations and workflow automations (e.g., allowing customers to build their own automations with your embedded iPaaS).

[![Embedded iPaaS visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded0c3fe0bfdc59eae1_AD_4nXfLUO-M58VXsFOGdDjhCgJVtjq0F95DmhTIuApYIFSvI03lT7rAhcoZPuNezmUqtcs3NJaoQiEV41xC6qylAFnjOd-g6g7ZdIr9eIP2UgNmEqgj0PWSR6VE-f6Kuf4Tczd2uj82zw.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded0c3fe0bfdc59eae1_AD_4nXfLUO-M58VXsFOGdDjhCgJVtjq0F95DmhTIuApYIFSvI03lT7rAhcoZPuNezmUqtcs3NJaoQiEV41xC6qylAFnjOd-g6g7ZdIr9eIP2UgNmEqgj0PWSR6VE-f6Kuf4Tczd2uj82zw.webp)

‍

Common embedded iPaaS solutions include Workato, Tray.ai, Paragon, and Prismatic.

## **Benefits of integration platforms**

The benefits of using integration platforms vary depending on whether you’re considering internal or customer-facing integrations.

Here are some of the benefits of internal integration platforms:

- **Time savings:** by outsourcing the integration development and maintenance to a 3rd-party, your engineers can focus more of their time and effort on core product initiatives

- **Improved employee experience:** building and maintaining an integration is incredibly arduous, stressful, and never-ending work (at least until the integration gets deprecated). By allowing your engineers to offload at least some parts of these projects to a [3rd-party integration platform](https://www.merge.dev/blog/3rd-party-integration), they can spend more time on the projects they actually enjoy and are uniquely equipped to tackle

- **Cost savings:** assuming the integration platform is effective, it can free up hundreds of engineering hours every year. And, given how expensive engineers are, the return of using the integration platform could be well worth the investment

And here are some of the benefits of customer-facing integration platforms:

- [**White label integrations**](https://www.merge.dev/blog/white-label-api-integration) **:** You can offer the integrations in your own brand’s look and feel and without having to mention the vendor, making it seem as though your team built and maintains the integrations

[![White label screenshot of Merge Link](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded64f04a4615db8df6_AD_4nXdR1lDGeA9aXp0qzoVQCzuIzKuACYhEYx_51cvLYSbE-XMKR6akFsrrdpH0B1J6RJlFrTRi3yMW4Ta5Hk9ukfP8TtziawwC5deBG6qUbQOMY-1pdntVUPYWrtfG0n7eFCCQDXzo.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded64f04a4615db8df6_AD_4nXdR1lDGeA9aXp0qzoVQCzuIzKuACYhEYx_51cvLYSbE-XMKR6akFsrrdpH0B1J6RJlFrTRi3yMW4Ta5Hk9ukfP8TtziawwC5deBG6qUbQOMY-1pdntVUPYWrtfG0n7eFCCQDXzo.webp)

_Merge lets you white label_ [_Merge Link_](https://docs.merge.dev/get-started/link/) _, a UI component you can embed into your product to help customers authenticate your integrations_

- **Scalability:** Using a [universal API solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/universal-api) (or unified API solution), you can add hundreds of integrations to your product through a single integration build

[![A screenshot of Merge's HRIS integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded378b19c76b93aa95_AD_4nXc2-SzQxfAJE_JsgmOD3iIdrw-9fB2ZSLDnTX6CkMSg2wlwig83mZ9hnwfqQosB_vUmixljlwLs5dkiV6KI8np9-3MG-mSUBsHwvHm6Wb7UCypf4PtilOHw9zXY6Wvg7fmGrrpwJA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67575ded378b19c76b93aa95_AD_4nXc2-SzQxfAJE_JsgmOD3iIdrw-9fB2ZSLDnTX6CkMSg2wlwig83mZ9hnwfqQosB_vUmixljlwLs5dkiV6KI8np9-3MG-mSUBsHwvHm6Wb7UCypf4PtilOHw9zXY6Wvg7fmGrrpwJA.webp)

_For HRIS alone, Merge lets you add more than 70 integrations through its unified API_

- **Ease of maintaining and managing the integrations:** Certain product integration platforms can also help you maintain integrations (through their own engineers) and manage any via tooling like automated issue detection, fully-searchable logs, and more.

[![A screenshot of a linking issue in Merge's Dashboard](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65f8547883d3902fd54bd58e_Q28qNAEHxzETiYJcCdpsDSO5yf0M9m_IFUhuq9XgWvCYRaY3Agjba-JrRL1cDOY3DhorpeLGL8l5Shpgnr2z_MwQSAJITBjJwsfIX6lfqgGTm1cLwPZOovddu1J7ABYxcZo9usM0KbmBBQhBwoaErLs.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65f8547883d3902fd54bd58e_Q28qNAEHxzETiYJcCdpsDSO5yf0M9m_IFUhuq9XgWvCYRaY3Agjba-JrRL1cDOY3DhorpeLGL8l5Shpgnr2z_MwQSAJITBjJwsfIX6lfqgGTm1cLwPZOovddu1J7ABYxcZo9usM0KbmBBQhBwoaErLs.webp)

_Merge can auto-detect common issues and provide steps for addressing them_

Taken together, you’ll be able to offer healthy, reliable, and performant integrations over time without having to involve your developers.
