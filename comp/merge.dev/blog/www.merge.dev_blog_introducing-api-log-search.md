What would the old you do?

The message arrives from your customer: “My employee, Jamie Smith, her home email isn’t showing in the dashboard and now we’ve failed to send her tax documents in time!!”

What _would_ the _old_ you do? Consider what could’ve gone wrong. Wait for your engineering team to go through [API logs](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-logs). Could it just be that your customer never put in their email?

Of course, that was the _old_ you.

This is the new you. You use a [Unified API](https://www.merge.dev/what-is-a-unified-api) for your integrations.

So: just go to the Merge API request logs page. Search: “Amy Chan.” Filter that search by requests from the Unified API to the API provider that your customer uses.

There it is: the problem was that the data was never stored. Your reply: ask your customer to fill the info in.

That’s how easy it is to solve issues with Merge’s API log search.

One search bar. Every request, to and from Merge. Text searchable, and filterable by any aspect of the log.
