We're excited to announce thatMerge is now available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace—a digital catalog with thousands of product listings from independent software vendors (ISVs), data providers, and channel partners that helps simplify procurement, provisioning, and governance of software, data, and services.

Merge is the first unified API solution available in AWS Marketplace, leaving us positioned to capture demand from AWS customers that need to build product integrations quickly and at scale.

Anyone can now discover, learn about, and purchase Merge without leaving AWS Marketplace. This makes it easier than ever to buy Merge and leverage it to offer dozens, if not hundreds, of customer-facing integrations, whether that’s with clients’ HRIS solutions, ticketing platforms, CRM systems, accounting solutions, and more.

Additional benefits include:

- **Consolidated and standardized billing:** All software spend in AWS Marketplace appears on one bill, eliminating the need to get approval for additional budget items
- **Simple invoicing:** AWS Marketplace handles invoicing and provides flexible options for purchases and renewals
- **Discounts and credits:** Purchasing Merge through AWS Marketplace draws down committed spend for customers who have an Enterprise Discount Program (EDP)

Through our listing in AWS Marketplace, it’s now easier than ever for B2B SaaS companies to find, procure, and use Merge. We're thrilled to announce our partnership with AWS, a pivotal step in our commitment to empowering businesses to offer best-in-class integrations.

_To access Merge in AWS Marketplace_ [_visit our listing_](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-jgjtrfz5rysi4) _._

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
