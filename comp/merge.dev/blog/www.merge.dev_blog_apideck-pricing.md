Apideck offers unified APIs that help you add hundreds of integrations to your product, which include ERP solutions, HRIS platforms, and CRM tools.

They also [provide an integration marketplace](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace) to help you highlight their integrations on your site.

Given everything they offer, their pricing model can be complex. We’ll help break down how it works and whether it’s right for your integration strategy.

## **Pricing plan overview**

Since their unified APIs and integrations marketplace are different products, Apideck offers them in separate pricing plans.

[![How Apideck separates their unified API and integration marketplace offerings](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bde29bd2cfe231a343_AD_4nXdd1Qm5ovD7ObhzBt-4y26g5ZRfR263KcQdHO6G8-8P2hN4f1aFguSQU4VSk41lXiTDKs0uc-d6ROhzSzrq2DngKp30Q_Q7M3gyzcwXsBq7s6toi6M_0jYs86Est2O7Op3DhGAw6w.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bde29bd2cfe231a343_AD_4nXdd1Qm5ovD7ObhzBt-4y26g5ZRfR263KcQdHO6G8-8P2hN4f1aFguSQU4VSk41lXiTDKs0uc-d6ROhzSzrq2DngKp30Q_Q7M3gyzcwXsBq7s6toi6M_0jYs86Est2O7Op3DhGAw6w.png)

### **Unified APIs pricing plans**

Apideck offers three plans: Launch, Growth, and Enterprise.

[![Apideck's 3 pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bee9eaca68f99cf0ca_AD_4nXdkFnHvCTZMQ3TkWR-R9UDcixSCJf89zKCNZuYYmgBKCRGRuohdT_fj2vq9OQFDPeU-IeyRHbD1JZkmG23gXKHJwcy_8RmoTlnf0XRQxSw-SLv1O-qlGtEG63Oe9iOH1MK9ntl0.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bee9eaca68f99cf0ca_AD_4nXdkFnHvCTZMQ3TkWR-R9UDcixSCJf89zKCNZuYYmgBKCRGRuohdT_fj2vq9OQFDPeU-IeyRHbD1JZkmG23gXKHJwcy_8RmoTlnf0XRQxSw-SLv1O-qlGtEG63Oe9iOH1MK9ntl0.png)

As you move up these plans, you’ll be able to access:

- More advanced features for syncing custom data (e.g., Custom Field Mapping)
- Additional unified API categories
- More API calls every month
- An SLA for a faster response time
- Security features, like single-sign on

You’ll also have a bigger voice when it comes to requesting specific connectors. In other words, Apideck is likely to prioritize your requests over ones that come from other customers that are on a lower pricing plan.

### **Integrations marketplace pricing plans**

Their integrations marketplace is also organized in 3 plans with the same names: Launch, Growth, and Enterprise.

[![Apideck's Integrations Marketplace pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177be33483d698472d191_AD_4nXc2H7zc0tN8Fw-6hhoINPzcom_eQMAVI6K4JjXYbkyp-zn73wJwZZt12hcxf8uSOkuOZRaXAiXIjScOlEJBdQ0VDO0Q8UjbG5h-j0v-vn9dlqehfv4Z_j9iUpiU6yksO51fPV_8mw.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177be33483d698472d191_AD_4nXc2H7zc0tN8Fw-6hhoINPzcom_eQMAVI6K4JjXYbkyp-zn73wJwZZt12hcxf8uSOkuOZRaXAiXIjScOlEJBdQ0VDO0Q8UjbG5h-j0v-vn9dlqehfv4Z_j9iUpiU6yksO51fPV_8mw.png)

As you move up in these plans, you’ll be able to access:

- Additional listings (i.e., you can list more integrations)
- More internal users, or people at your company who can manage the marketplace over time
- Multi-language support, which can be helpful when the integrations can appeal to prospects and customers in countries where English isn’t the primary language
- Enterprise-grade support through an SLA
- Custom CSS support to ensure that the marketplace can match your brand's look and feel

The Enterprise plan also offers add ons, like professional services to help you implement and manage the marketplace, and custom HTML support for even more control of the marketplace’s UI.

## **Pros and cons of Apideck’s pricing plans**

As you analyze Apideck’s pricing plans for their unified APIs, it’s worth keeping the following pros and cons in mind:

**Pros**

- Apideck is one of the cheapest [unified API vendors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/what-is-a-unified-api) in the market, making it a relatively less intimidating investment

- They let you choose between a monthly or yearly plan (which is discounted by 10%) to accommodate whichever investment level you feel comfortable with

- They offer a free trial for any unified API (up to 2,500 API requests) to help you test their integrations and confirm that they support your use cases

**Cons**

- Their pricing is largely based on API calls. This is unpredictable as you scale—as individual integrations can require a different volume of API calls to get the same information. As a result, you can quickly end up having to go on their Enterprise plan and pay more than you anticipated

- The shared Slack channel is only available for a limited time (up to 3 months). Their integrations can still break any time after that time window, so this can easily compromise Apideck's ability to resolve issues quickly on your behalf

- The Apideck team doesn’t offer comprehensive go-to-market support—whether that’s helping you come up with the best ways to price your integrations, market them, or support them

## **A look at Merge—the leading unified API solution**

Merge, which also offers a suite of unified APIs to help you add hundreds of integrations, addresses the issues in Apideck’s pricing plans and more.

[![A visual of how Merge works](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bd2077b0fe28022b6e_AD_4nXeK8_XPWeUAyPSMrRoavxq0kvlyqi0QqvCkUeuAMYh0ue6bY90iDPi74ig8_rxlGItVPJD1x8DYMWPn_PsQzKFcLwIn8GSjxgH81G0n0PJCXDw5mpORCB-dRdBMbhVuSqvdk61aTg.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67e177bd2077b0fe28022b6e_AD_4nXeK8_XPWeUAyPSMrRoavxq0kvlyqi0QqvCkUeuAMYh0ue6bY90iDPi74ig8_rxlGItVPJD1x8DYMWPn_PsQzKFcLwIn8GSjxgH81G0n0PJCXDw5mpORCB-dRdBMbhVuSqvdk61aTg.png)

_Merge lets you add hundreds of integrations across popular software categories, like file storage, HRIS, and ticketing_

For example, Merge offers:

- More comprehensive [integration monitoring capabilities](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-monitoring) across plans, such as automated issue detection

- Pricing based on linked accounts (or the number of customers that adopt one of your integrations), which is easier to predict and more closely tied to the value you realize from the integrations.

- Sandbox access to third-party platforms, allowing you to test the integrations thoroughly before pushing them to production

- A single-tenant to provide an additional level of data security and meet strict data storage requirements

In short, Merge offers a more enterprise-grade integration solution that can scale alongside your business.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
