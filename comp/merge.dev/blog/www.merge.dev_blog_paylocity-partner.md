Paylocity, an HR and payroll provider, is used by tens of thousands of organizations around the world and supports more than 2 million weekly users.

Given the platform’s popularity, your customers likely use it and want your product to integrate with it.

To help support this, we’ve launched a partnership with Paylocity!

Here’s a closer look at our partnership and how it can help you integrate with Paylocity.

### **How our partnership with Paylocity works**

Merge has partnered with Paylocity to offer customers a path to both onboard the integration and form their own Paylocity partnerships quickly.

Once you sign a marketplace agreement with Paylocity, you’ll be eligible for certification as a partner and a tile in [the Paylocity Marketplace](https://www.paylocity.com/our-products/integrations/marketplace/?)—giving your organization great brand exposure and helping prospects learn about your integration with their software.

### **How our partnership will help us support our Paylocity integration**

Through the partnership, Merge has a direct line of communication with Paylocity’s developer support team. This means that if an issue comes up, we can work with them to resolve it quickly.

In addition, Merge will work with Paylocity to maintain and support the integration so that you can focus on running your business.

Finally, Merge has a sandbox Paylocity account, enabling your team to test the integration rigorously via dummy data before pushing it to production.

### **Final thoughts**

We’re committed to helping our customers add a reliable, secure, and performant Paylocity integration to their products, and this partnership is just one step towards helping us achieve this aim.

You can learn more about our customer-facing Paylocity integration by visiting [this page](https://www.merge.dev/integrations/paylocity). And you can learn more about how you can leverage our unified API to not only integrate with Paylocity but also 70+ other HRIS solutions by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fworkday-partnership).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
