Prismatic is an embedded iPaaS solution that lets you build integrations and workflow automations between your product and your customers’ applications.

The platform offers [pre-built API connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector) across software categories to help you build integrations quickly; an integration marketplace that enables customers to discover and activate integrations themselves; integration observability features to provide visibility and context on specific integration issues–and more.

To help you assess the platform and determine if it’s right for your business, we’ll break down Prismatic’s pricing plans.

## **Overview on Prismatic’s pricing strategy**

Prismatic offers 3 pricing plans: Scale, Enterprise, and Custom.

[![Screenshot of Prismatic's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3a9da4e19d489d9f3a7c_Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%201.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3a9da4e19d489d9f3a7c_Screenshot%202025-05-09%20at%201.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)

Each plan requires you to connect with their team and there’s no cost figures outlined.

That said, the Scale plan includes all of the foundational components to get started. And as you move up these plans, the main changes are the security and performance capabilities you’d unlock.

More security conscious customers may request to host the integrated data on-prem to have complete control over it (on the Enterprise plan); customers that anticipate supporting a high volume of integrations may need high concurrency limits to prevent sync delays (on the Enterprise plan); customers that are focused on mitigating the impact of any issues will want an SLA (on the Custom plan)—and the list goes on.

It’s also worth noting that the Scale plan doesn’t allow your customers to build any integrations—your team has to implement and manage all of them on the customer’s behalf.

#### Don't settle for Prismatic

## **Pros and cons of Prismatic’s pricing strategy**

Here are some of the benefits and drawbacks of their pricing model:

### **Pros**

- **The Scale plan is fairly comprehensive.** It lets you build unlimited integrations and provide [embedded integration marketplaces](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace) across your customer base—which are the core features of their platform.

- **Enterprise-grade security features are covered in most plans.** You can use either the Enterprise or Custom plan to access the security features you need to move upmarket with your integrations

- **Every plan offers a high level of support.** The Scale plan lets you access email and chat support, includes a dedicated account manager, and provides a standard SLA. And as you move up to an Enterprise or Custom plan, the level of support would only get better. For example, the Enterprise plan offers “White-glove” support via email and chat (which likely translates to faster response times, more resources assigned to support you, etc.)

### **Cons**

- **There’s no transparency on pricing.** You can’t find out how much a plan costs without speaking to a sales rep. This can lead you to take a meeting only to learn that their pricing is out of your budget or doesn’t meet your [integration needs](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-requirements)

- **They don’t offer HIPAA compliance on their Launch plan.** Failing to meet this foundational compliance measure can prevent you from getting many, if not most, of your customers to adopt your integrations

[![A screenshot of the security features and compliance requirements Prismatic meets across plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e38bace3940049e102d85_AD_4nXf8tCDr2PaizqtG5lbPYb4PrW1FMpe12j2ApbaIBpsss38UvO_K-LysSSyOKho9V4dr4bsCUrSPenM1V2ai6cq73A0l1o9BBnDjDqoBJv10u5O-a_RLEjKfNEGetczZPlGGXcg-CA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e38bace3940049e102d85_AD_4nXf8tCDr2PaizqtG5lbPYb4PrW1FMpe12j2ApbaIBpsss38UvO_K-LysSSyOKho9V4dr4bsCUrSPenM1V2ai6cq73A0l1o9BBnDjDqoBJv10u5O-a_RLEjKfNEGetczZPlGGXcg-CA.png)

_Prismatic also doesn’t offer CJIS compliance on their Scale plan_

- **There’s no trial or proof of concept option.** You can’t test drive their integrations or any of their other features before signing up for one of their plans. This makes your investment in the platform relatively risky and uncomfortable

Note: There may be some proof of concept option available once you connect with their team. It just isn’t mentioned on their site.

## **How Merge addresses these drawbacks**

Merge, the leading unified API solution, not only offers HIPAA compliance across its plans but also complies with other critical security frameworks, such as GDPR, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 Type 2.

Merge also provides more transparency on its pricing and offers _every_ prospect the opportunity to participate in a proof of concept to validate their integration use cases.

_A snapshot of Merge’s Launch plan_

Last but not least, Merge offers a fundamentally different approach to helping you build integrations.

Instead of forcing you to build each integration in Prismatic’s “low-code integration designer”, you can simply build to Merge’s Unified API to unlock hundreds of cross-category integrations for your product.

[![A screenshot that shows that Merge lets you add accounting, ATS, HRIS, CRM, file storage, and ticketing integrations through a single, unified API](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3e7f5ee69509d1505445_Homepage%20hero%20illustration%20(5).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/681e3e7f5ee69509d1505445_Homepage%20hero%20illustration%20(5).png)

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
