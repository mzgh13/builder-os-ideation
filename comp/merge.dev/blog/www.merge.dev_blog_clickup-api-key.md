In the ever-changing landscape of project management and team collaboration solutions, ClickUp has persisted as a top option.

While you can benefit from ClickUp’s standalone features and capabilities in a variety of ways, you can realize even more value by integrating ClickUp with your product or your internal applications.

Before you can integrate with ClickUp’s API, however, you’ll need to procure your unique API key. This guide will break down the steps for doing exactly that.

## Step 1: Create an account

ClickUp is completely free to sign up. You can create a free account by [signing up here](https://clickup.com/).

## Step 1: Navigate to settings

Log into your ClickUp account. Once logged in, navigate to the top right corner, and click the circle with your initials in it.

[![Navigating to settings](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb618db67a3f7f68b601_H46BOm8MsmmwrfZLGtZqoEeD5ZzwOMhB4uyjPoK0jln68aezigx6b6ULdU04tt_BsCWj-bLYWMZOfgNbmIvszATbr5-01WU84HEfZ7zQcso8sGy35KJorPvzn42NMM01QVI75FoMTCMP0GhukHuQlWk.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb618db67a3f7f68b601_H46BOm8MsmmwrfZLGtZqoEeD5ZzwOMhB4uyjPoK0jln68aezigx6b6ULdU04tt_BsCWj-bLYWMZOfgNbmIvszATbr5-01WU84HEfZ7zQcso8sGy35KJorPvzn42NMM01QVI75FoMTCMP0GhukHuQlWk.webp)

You’ll see “Settings” in the sidebar under your name. You can go ahead and select it.

## Step 2: Select "Apps"

Scroll down the left side-bar until you see “Apps.” Once you click it, you’ll see a place to generate an API Token.

[![Selecting "Apps"](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb613b4ad5824d3cede8_XIsTuiIjjHv6hOKXFNT5dXv5LUU76zcCPCgfW1i1yqwUOAoc6lxZ9mLiy-vfCPB1i1VdcQsM2xhjPGOq7AaMjBzscoIHZpXcxuPBHNNFvu5JVgVCtkMhl-B5J2UbZnOjxi4MvFqOpn5GbfhwZsL41qo.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb613b4ad5824d3cede8_XIsTuiIjjHv6hOKXFNT5dXv5LUU76zcCPCgfW1i1yqwUOAoc6lxZ9mLiy-vfCPB1i1VdcQsM2xhjPGOq7AaMjBzscoIHZpXcxuPBHNNFvu5JVgVCtkMhl-B5J2UbZnOjxi4MvFqOpn5GbfhwZsL41qo.webp)

## Step 3: Create a new API key

In the API key section, click “Generate”. An API key will then be made available for use.

Now you’re set to continue building your integration with ClickUp!

_Note: If you ever need to revoke or regenerate your API key, you can usually do so within the API key management section._

## Bonus step: Store your API key in a secure location

Consider storing your API key in a secure location, such as a password manager, to prevent bad actors from accessing your integration.

## Other key considerations for building to ClickUp's API

There’s obviously more to building to ClickUp’s API than retrieving your API key. Let’s dive a bit deeper on additional key items.

### Pricing

Before starting your integration build, it’s worth considering the platform's pricing structure.

ClickUp offers a tiered pricing model with various plans that cater to different organizational needs. Understanding the features included in each plan and their associated costs ensures that your integration aligns with both your budget and functionality requirements.

[![ClickUp's pricing](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb619e93674fbe8adfb4_5Z72ixios5W_ZjCUUAIK6-dInQsofbvp2XhSfbK3jDJF6cWjmeZoZkmZ1FJMCBmmsys3j8TSe6vaX_xxcBnBHoOgqWiR5eIdjqr6Oes9r1VOmYobyEnSnsMwGn9vaDER7Nj2h8kGrhYVIlZlJlZm1Gg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb619e93674fbe8adfb4_5Z72ixios5W_ZjCUUAIK6-dInQsofbvp2XhSfbK3jDJF6cWjmeZoZkmZ1FJMCBmmsys3j8TSe6vaX_xxcBnBHoOgqWiR5eIdjqr6Oes9r1VOmYobyEnSnsMwGn9vaDER7Nj2h8kGrhYVIlZlJlZm1Gg.webp)

### Rate limits

ClickUp, like many API providers, imposes rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability.

ClickUp provides specific [rate limit policies](https://clickup.com/api/developer-portal/rate-limits/) based on your workspace plan. It’s worth considering these limits not only to avoid exceeding them but also to help you better determine the plan that best suits your business requirements.

[![ClickUp's rate limits](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb61678b018611674831_eMYKTgU4phht0GUcQqoJC_ut4Vs3QxbRsdzsMAxf8RaBYuUmwpqDkwCPMIgDXXy-6L2BT0XckYOAwz88BaGGsvzfhw8d5J4CdAZnUS6M2m7BFo-wNyCYszxyvh-RpSh7dSI5qzp-DRta8-_um7ccwYE.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655bbb61678b018611674831_eMYKTgU4phht0GUcQqoJC_ut4Vs3QxbRsdzsMAxf8RaBYuUmwpqDkwCPMIgDXXy-6L2BT0XckYOAwz88BaGGsvzfhw8d5J4CdAZnUS6M2m7BFo-wNyCYszxyvh-RpSh7dSI5qzp-DRta8-_um7ccwYE.webp)

### Errors to look out for

When building integrations with ClickUp, it's essential to be aware of potential errors that may arise during API interactions. Common issues are rate limits being reached, a team isn’t authorized, a token isn’t found, among others.

To help prepare for any issues, it’s worth reviewing ClickUp's error codes and their respective meanings. You can find these details [here](https://clickup.com/api/developer-portal/errors/).

## Final thoughts

Many of your clients use project management tools that extend beyond ClickUp, such as Asana, Trello, or Jira.

You can offer all of the project management and ticketing integrations your customers need by simply integrating with Merge’s [Ticketing and Project Management Unified API](https://www.merge.dev/categories/ticketing-api).

To learn more about the API, and Merge’s platform more broadly, you can [schedule a demo](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fclickup-api-key) with one of our integration experts!

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
