@Merge

We’re thrilled to announce that we’ve entered into a formal partnership with Gusto, a leading HR and payroll solution for SMBs!

Read on to learn how Merge can help you build an approved Gusto integration as well as how your product can use a customer-facing, API-based Gusto integration.

## **How to use Merge to build a Gusto integration**

**‍**

The integration will be offered to all clients on Merge’s Professional and Enterprise plans.

Assuming you fall under one of these plans, you’ll then need to take the following steps:

1\. Receive security requirements from the Merge team (i.e., your dedicated CSM and/or solution architect). These could vary depending on your integration use cases with Gusto.

2\. Create an account in [Gusto’s Developer Portal](https://dev.gusto.com/) to accept Gusto’s  [Developer Terms of Service](https://gusto.com/legal/terms/developer-terms-of-service) and use their developer tools and resources.

3\. Complete Gusto’s Production Pre-approval application (provided to you by Merge). The form asks a variety of questions related to your business and your security measures and asks for certain reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type 2 Report).

4\. Gusto will perform a security review to validate the controls in place and may ask follow-up questions. Assuming you pass the review, Gusto will provision your developer account, generate production API credentials, and set up your scopes.

5\. You’ll receive production API credentials, which you can input under your Gusto integration settings in Merge (click on "Set up organization-level credentials", as shown below).

Note: [This help center article](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/10354314-gusto-how-do-i-set-up-my-integration) breaks down each of these steps in more detail.

## **How to use the Gusto integration**

Once you’ve connected your product to Gusto via Merge, you can power a variety of use cases for customers.

These can vary as they depend on the type of platform you offer, but here are some worth noting:

- **Automated provisioning:** Allow customers to add, remove, or update users automatically based on the associated employee changes in Gusto

- **Automated gifting:** If you offer a gift-giving platform, your customers can use the integrated employee data from Gusto to deliver the right gifts at the right times to the right employees. For instance, automatically trigger a gift-giving workflow when an employee gets promoted in Gusto


- **Headcount planning:** If you offer a financial planning and analysis (FP&A) solution, customers can use their employee compensation data from Gusto to power models that help them make headcount decisions


- **Assigning trainings:** If you offer a learning and development platform, customers can use their employee data from Gusto to assign the appropriate set of training courses across their employee base. For example, your customers can assign security trainings to new hires during their onboarding

## **Final thoughts** ‍

Here at Merge, our mission is to make secure data access easy. We’re thrilled to extend that mission to customers that adopt our Gusto integration.

If you’re already a Merge customer and interested in using our Gusto integration, you can speak to your dedicated customer success manager at Merge. And if you’re new to Merge, you can [schedule a demo with our team here](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fgusto-partnership).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
