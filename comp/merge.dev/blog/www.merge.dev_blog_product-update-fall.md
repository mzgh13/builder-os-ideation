@Merge

Our team is constantly releasing new security features, additional integrations, enhanced syncing capabilities, and more to help customers add reliable, flexible, and secure integrations to their products.

We highlighted several of these releases during our inaugural webinar, “ [The Product Update](https://www.merge.dev/webinars/the-product-update-with-merge-fall-2024).”

Here’s just a snapshot of some of the features we covered and that we hope you can leverage.

### **Onboard customers around the world to Merge’s integrations with Link Localization**

Many of our customers work with organizations in different regions. As a result, they’d need to offer [Merge Link](https://docs.merge.dev/get-started/link/)—a UI component that lets users authenticate and authorize their integrations—in different languages.

To meet this need, we’ve built Link Localization, which can automatically translate the Merge Link interface to another language for a specific customer(s).

Link Localization is already available in German, but we’re set to release it in French and Spanish within weeks, and we’ll add additional languages over the coming months.

[![Merge Link visualizations for English, German, and French](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459b8d336d77d5236a3a_AD_4nXfIstF289x8rJJIVgS2FhhvY6QoJ3k6rkG9GaIN1u3LvMwMYyWKwPms_gBw-5dVPNaNFi-H4m8YRpBJyTYxV54-3YL7l-UNedaaNsirQODZDSXHI2oKmB0Aac3_kVqwT2wKvf8RNDPS_kfQ4Nv-yhDelRKA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459b8d336d77d5236a3a_AD_4nXfIstF289x8rJJIVgS2FhhvY6QoJ3k6rkG9GaIN1u3LvMwMYyWKwPms_gBw-5dVPNaNFi-H4m8YRpBJyTYxV54-3YL7l-UNedaaNsirQODZDSXHI2oKmB0Aac3_kVqwT2wKvf8RNDPS_kfQ4Nv-yhDelRKA.webp)

### **Offer a best-in-class FP&A solution with our general ledger endpoint**

To support customers in the financial planning and analysis (FP&A) space, we’re adding a general ledger endpoint to accounting integrations.

This will allow our customers to access all the transactions that affect their clients’ general ledgers. In turn, our FP&A customers can power up-to-date, personalized, and actionable forecasts as well as help users plan for a wide range of scenarios effectively.

[![GL endpoint visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459be9a2a3a55e2d2af0_AD_4nXcHxah35KjRAZEbrRSFdjAe_8Jk6RXW6w7UDBAixYJKI76e7v_wZGpLdiU2UWOlYrrOdDW5beUPCDABwnaOPRQvxc8dpHAsHwTwMGGyFEHaS5Zj3Ow2mMuLpk1Mq8JheH9kEoxSkegpJ8vKBbILgonXoic2.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459be9a2a3a55e2d2af0_AD_4nXcHxah35KjRAZEbrRSFdjAe_8Jk6RXW6w7UDBAixYJKI76e7v_wZGpLdiU2UWOlYrrOdDW5beUPCDABwnaOPRQvxc8dpHAsHwTwMGGyFEHaS5Zj3Ow2mMuLpk1Mq8JheH9kEoxSkegpJ8vKBbILgonXoic2.webp)

The endpoint is slated to go live for several accounting integrations soon, including Xero, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Online, and NetSuite.

If you’re an existing customer, you can learn more about it by connecting with your dedicated CSM; otherwise, you can [schedule a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fproduct-update-fall).

### **Deliver a seamless onboarding experience by personalizing Merge Link**

As your customers add integrations via Merge Link, you’ll likely want the experience to feel like a natural extension of your platform.

With this in mind, we’ve added several features that let you customize Merge Link.

You can, for example, pick and choose Merge Link’s font type and colors to match your brand’s look and feel.

[![How to customize Merge Link in our Dashboard](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459ace37ee43f226ac45_AD_4nXe_YG97E-8Db7gf6GfeL99PQCrcok2zJ3Z22_Gku_mBPoII5LpwIRLbYiRjAvCgIm_iRROSyvvL1Cqv7IZy_1a8DM7QWmihZ8apeHlGMRZj5k9kRFv7JGeOzEizg5-UK2t3lk-2WQmAKleg6g64kLLHPu8O.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6722459ace37ee43f226ac45_AD_4nXe_YG97E-8Db7gf6GfeL99PQCrcok2zJ3Z22_Gku_mBPoII5LpwIRLbYiRjAvCgIm_iRROSyvvL1Cqv7IZy_1a8DM7QWmihZ8apeHlGMRZj5k9kRFv7JGeOzEizg5-UK2t3lk-2WQmAKleg6g64kLLHPu8O.webp)

You can also white label any of the user guides we’ve built in our help center and that we link out to from Merge Link. This includes adding your logo to the top of these pages and using your own subdomain.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
