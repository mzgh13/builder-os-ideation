@Merge

As you look to outsource your customer-facing integrations, you’ll likely evaluate Pandium, an embedded integration platform as a service (iPaaS).

The platform lets you add hundreds of integrations across software categories as well as build and manage an [in-app marketplace](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace), where customers can discover and adopt your integrations.

All of this said, the platform may not be the best integration solution for your organization.

To help you decide if it is, we’ll compare it to several competitors.

_Note: This article was written on 10/31/2024. The information below can change in the future._

## **Merge**

Merge lets you add hundreds of integrations to your product through its single, unified API.

**Top features:**

- **Integration observability:** Merge identifies and diagnoses issues across your integrations and provides steps for remediating them

- **White labeling:** You can whitelabel everything from Merge Link—the UI component Merge offers to authenticate integrations—to help guides when customers need extra support in authenticating an integration

- **Localization:** You can translate Merge Link to different languages, ensuring that your users can add an integration, regardless of where they’re based

[![Screenshot of Merge Link Localization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c9760816130559d6dfe4_AD_4nXdB2IxDsUWlKdkDVOMRrVSeZ0RN5MVU_MmVKXM99Vm1pWY305YCqgNg86SexQEhHUfm4TbDb7c40vYRdMOahaOxp3Ge1Q1ywokpf0EFJAO-qnJd9jMZMCciyy_Tw1-2v-mgIw3dxDM5G4_BjfjKKxPRPko.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c9760816130559d6dfe4_AD_4nXdB2IxDsUWlKdkDVOMRrVSeZ0RN5MVU_MmVKXM99Vm1pWY305YCqgNg86SexQEhHUfm4TbDb7c40vYRdMOahaOxp3Ge1Q1ywokpf0EFJAO-qnJd9jMZMCciyy_Tw1-2v-mgIw3dxDM5G4_BjfjKKxPRPko.webp)

#### **When to choose Merge over Pandium**

- **You want to avoid building one integration at a time.** Merge lets you add hundreds of integrations through a single build, while Pandium forces you to add integrations incrementally

- **You’re looking for GTM support.** Merge’s customer success team can help you determine the best pricing, marketing, and support strategies for your integrations

- **You need enterprise-grade security features.** Merge offers a wide range of features to help you sync data securely and only access the data that’s absolutely necessary

[![A screenshot of Common Model Scopes](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/667ae3c7d773ba4edcf385fa_AD_4nXc_Xp5Uby0z6xeS21KbpWPixWKLohiusIZ9UBmEIuc6ly_dGKC1d_L-Q6H3tlJhGggRfDEomOjxk3Gsw3swgnoP6YBojI76pwC22P9QvBLv9to1u4jHfhZyWOv435JKvN4rwdkAExK9q3qRJedIIERe4sb5.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/667ae3c7d773ba4edcf385fa_AD_4nXc_Xp5Uby0z6xeS21KbpWPixWKLohiusIZ9UBmEIuc6ly_dGKC1d_L-Q6H3tlJhGggRfDEomOjxk3Gsw3swgnoP6YBojI76pwC22P9QvBLv9to1u4jHfhZyWOv435JKvN4rwdkAExK9q3qRJedIIERe4sb5.webp)

## **Workato**

_Using Workbot®, users can approve or reject PTO requests from Slack or Microsoft Teams_

#### **When to choose Workato over Pandium**

- **You want to leverage additional integration and automation solutions.** Unlike Pandium, Workato can also help you add internal integrations and automations, build workflow applications, provide endpoints, and more

- **You’re looking for a platform that has a track record of success with enterprise businesses.** Workato works with countless enterprise organizations across industries, such as Coupa, HP, Cisco, Adobe, and more

- **You need to leverage a wide range of application connectors.** Workato offers hundreds of additional [API connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector) across categories, including AI/ML tools, customer support software, etc.

## **Zapier**

Zapier is a task-based automation tool that lets you build both internal and customer-facing automations.

#### **Top features:**

- **“Zap” workflow builder:** A simple UX that uses triggers and actions to power workflow automations **‍**
- **Interfaces:** Build internal or external applications that are powered by Zaps **‍**
- **Chatbots (in Beta):** Set up customizable, AI-powered chatbots to streamline any number of tasks

#### **When to choose Zapier over Pandium**

- **You want to access additional integration and automation solutions.** Like Workato, Zapier lets you build internal integrations, workflow applications, and more, making it an effective, all-in-one solution

- **You’d like to use AI to build integrations and automations.** Zapier offers Copilots that can help you build Zaps from natural language

[![Zapier's copilot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66466339349d2b414b77c001_-cV1D50apkp5hPop_YO5UfNm854-13Clbcpw-aPEhwGQzBZcYPQs25rqafE1vbYSjZmBVDPIbkuNJEmAYdz5Rdj4dogqD0emxXtmvn1-yncKaSxQKAoXbT0m_-k73zW9vJOWxIfsQJUSVA_ZIDCBbz8.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66466339349d2b414b77c001_-cV1D50apkp5hPop_YO5UfNm854-13Clbcpw-aPEhwGQzBZcYPQs25rqafE1vbYSjZmBVDPIbkuNJEmAYdz5Rdj4dogqD0emxXtmvn1-yncKaSxQKAoXbT0m_-k73zW9vJOWxIfsQJUSVA_ZIDCBbz8.webp)

_Zapier’s Copilot lets you build Zaps end-to-end_

- **You’d prefer an integration solution that has a longer track record of success.** Zapier was founded in 2011 (Pandium was founded in 2017) and works with significantly more customers

## **Tray.ai**

Tray.ai offers both a traditional and embedded iPaaS to help address all of their customers’ [integration requirements](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-requirements).

#### **Top features:**

- **Merlin Intelligence:** Build workflow automations, get suggestions on improving or building out existing automations, and receive documentation on any—all from providing plain language

- **Integration marketplace:** Build and provide automation templates, customize the workflow builder for specific integrations, and use a white labeled UX to make it seem as though you’re providing the integrations

- **API management:** develop, deploy, and manage any number of endpoints

#### **When to choose Tray.ai over Pandium**

- **You want to build internal integrations.** Tray.ai was initially built for internal integrations, so the platform is well suited to support this use case

- **You’d like to access product-specific trainings to onboard your team faster.** Through the “Tray Academy”, your team can become proficient with various facets of the platform; Pandium doesn’t offer any comparable type of training

- **You need customer proof points to get executive buy-in.** Tray.ai has a comprehensive library of case studies, which includes companies across different regions, sizes, and industries. Pandium, on the other hand, offers just a handful of case studies, most of which are with small companies

[![Tray.ai's case studies](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c9766bb545dc9aec20b3_AD_4nXeCowzjslP5LznBPJQGHeW0rIneQnujVmfWmj-ex6KwJF7Tm6sTL7JeD2bZMx1LUR3xdfW69eYBwEelILmZYBCq7B7j2jRj_7mC48M3p3qaoKjJcXFvPXRU3RUJ00w1PXhP3Gjh2ap65UTcicBh40MlBCoa.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c9766bb545dc9aec20b3_AD_4nXeCowzjslP5LznBPJQGHeW0rIneQnujVmfWmj-ex6KwJF7Tm6sTL7JeD2bZMx1LUR3xdfW69eYBwEelILmZYBCq7B7j2jRj_7mC48M3p3qaoKjJcXFvPXRU3RUJ00w1PXhP3Gjh2ap65UTcicBh40MlBCoa.webp)

## **Boomi**

Boomi helps 20,000+ companies build internal and customer-facing integrations.

[![A look at all of the integration solutions Boomi offers](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c977439671579d0b8382_AD_4nXflNwWWMkrnLLrGK1IOyHe-ykMWUCaXe-jui3JgwMZT3S7U-gWhzUv_i-X46_W8_TbgM2WgzfATMsIFmVAWxQB0iRBdLRKjz0wJv7gRjiFs0cSTqYpQ_ZUFhwvoczY9peKheMDXN8U7wCAvdov2rtq27I-r.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6723c977439671579d0b8382_AD_4nXflNwWWMkrnLLrGK1IOyHe-ykMWUCaXe-jui3JgwMZT3S7U-gWhzUv_i-X46_W8_TbgM2WgzfATMsIFmVAWxQB0iRBdLRKjz0wJv7gRjiFs0cSTqYpQ_ZUFhwvoczY9peKheMDXN8U7wCAvdov2rtq27I-r.webp)

_A look at all of the integration solutions Boomi offers_

#### **Top features:**

- **B2B integrations:** They support integrations with trading partners via electronic data interchange (EDI)

- **Event streams:** Their Event Streams Connector supports real-time data syncs at scale and through various delivery patterns (e.g., Pub-sub)

- **Low-code workflow builder:** They let you build internal or customer-facing workflow automations through a “low-code” UI

#### **When to choose Boomi over Pandium**

- **You want to access more pre-built connectors.** Boomi offers significantly more connectors than Pandium, and Boomi also covers many more categories

- **You need to build integrations with trading partners’ systems to expedite key workflows (e.g., order processing).** Boomi supports this scenario while Pandium doesn’t

- ‍ **You want to work with an integration platform that’s stable and established.** Boomi has been around for 20+ years and is likely better positioned financially to continue operating through bad economic conditions

#### Don’t settle for Pandium

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
