# Announcing Merge’s $55 million Series B

@Merge

We [are excited to announce](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/24/merge-raises-55m-series-b-for-its-unified-api/) that Merge has raised a $55 million Series B!

Accel led the round, with participation from our existing investors NEA and Addition. This brings our total funding to ~$74.5 million since we started building Merge in June 2020. We’re also thrilled to welcome Accel partner [Ben Fletcher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bfletch11/) to the Merge Board of Directors.

This is a huge milestone for our team, and I wanted to share some thoughts on where Merge is today and where we’re going.

## **Merge today**

One thing drives us: providing the best for our customers. That drive shaped by a strong product vision, demonstrated value, and a culture that brings out the best in people.

### ‍ **Product**

At the heart of our drive _is_ our unified API. A unified API abstracts away complex, disparate systems to provide an interface that is opinionated, comprehensive, and flexible. It makes a developer’s life easier.

The ethos of ‘unified’ informs not just our API, but every other aspect of our approach to building a next-generation platform. Each aspect of Merge— from our Dashboard experience, to our robust Logs and Issues Detection — is informed by what provides the greatest level of flexibility and ease to our customer.

### **Value**

Since our [Series A](https://merge.dev/blog/announcing-our-15-million-series-a-and-expanded-partnerships), we have continued to build on our product, scale our team, and get the word out about Merge. We now have over 3,000 free and paying organizations on our platform, including iconic companies like AngelList, TripActions, Divvy by Bill.com, Ramp, Apollo.io, Gem, and many more. We're grateful to all these customers that trust us to power their integrations.

Merge has proven to be both revenue-generating and cost-cutting for our users. Our integrations allow product engineering teams to [speed up their product roadmaps significantly](https://merge.dev/case-studies/ramp), lower the cost for experimentation, acquire customers using [vendors that they previously didn’t integrate with](https://merge.dev/case-studies/how-merge-unblocked-10x-in-sales-for-assembly), reduce the [amount of engineering involved in integrations](https://merge.dev/case-studies/how-drata-helps-thousands-of-companies-streamline-their-soc2-compliance-with-merge), and empower post-sales teams to diagnose end-user error.

### **Culture**

This success is only made possible by the Merge team. Merge today is the company that I always wanted to work at. Our team is ambitious, hard-working, and filled with good people who deeply care about our customers and what we are building. Two and a half years in and 55 people later, we have been able to continue our in-person culture across two cities. We are extremely proud of the team and community that we have built (and [we're hiring](https://www.merge.dev/careers)!).

## **Merge in the future**

We still have a lot of work to do. Even though we’ve already released 150 integrations in 2 years, our goal is to be the integration layer for every B2B company.

Our path there is through a laser focus on one thing: our customer. With this raise, we can continue to expand our team and invest in our product and customer experience.

On behalf of us all at Merge we couldn’t be more thrilled to jump into this next phase, together.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
