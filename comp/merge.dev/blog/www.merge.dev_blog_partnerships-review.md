Zack Kousnetz

Head of Partnerships

@Merge

We’re dedicated to building partnerships with industry leaders across our supported integration categories.

These partnerships offer a clear path for customers to establish their own partnerships, and they help us strengthen our integrations. For example, they can let us build to more endpoints, access more documentation and resources for managing integration issues, work directly with partners when there are issues with their APIs—and the list goes on!

Given all these benefits, we’re thrilled with the progress we’ve made in establishing pivotal partnerships throughout 2024.

You can read on to learn about some of them!

## **Workday**

Through our partnership with Workday, a financial management and human capital management (HCM) system, we’ll receive access to additional documentation for building to specific endpoints and managing integration issues, both of which have helped us build a deeper, more reliable Workday integration.

In addition, we’ll get access to development tenants through the partnership. This enables us to test certain aspects of our Workday syncs (e.g., certain authentication mechanisms) before pushing them to production. Plus, we’ll receive enablement and ongoing support from Workday’s Partner Integration Architects on all aspects of working with their APIs. This translates to fewer issues and a better user experience for our customers.

_You can learn more about our Workday integration by visiting_ [_this page_](https://www.merge.dev/integrations/workday) _. And if you’d like to learn more about our partnership with Workday you can_ [_read this blog post_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/workday-partnership) _._

## **Paylocity**

Our partnership with Paylocity, an online payroll & HR provider, gives us a direct line of communication with Paylocity’s developer support team. This means that if an issue comes up, we can work with them to resolve it quickly.

In addition, we have a sandbox Paylocity account. This enables us to help customers test their Paylocity integrations rigorously with dummy data before pushing them to production.

_Here’s more on_ [_our partnership with Paylocity_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/paylocity-partner) _. You can also learn more about our integration with the HR and payroll platform_ [_here_](https://www.merge.dev/integrations/paylocity) _._

## **Rippling**

We were the first unified API solution to partner with Rippling, a workforce management system that combines HR, IT, and Finance apps on a unified data platform.

The Rippling integration is available to clients on our Professional and Enterprise plans. If you’re interested in enabling the integration, we’ll submit an application to the Rippling App Shop on your behalf. If you’re approved, your customers will be able to connect to Rippling through the App Shop and/or via Merge Link in your product

As a Rippling partner, you’ll get access to a listing in the Rippling App Shop where Rippling customers can discover and install your app.

## **Justworks**

Our partnership with Justworks ensures that our customers integrate with the platform in the most secure, seamless, and performant way.

Through our partnership, we’ll also continue to help Justworks expand their API’s functionality by adding more endpoint support, improving their sync frequencies, enhancing their documentation, and more.

## **Final thoughts**

Our primary goal with partnerships is twofold: to offer the latest and best product integrations with SaaS vendors and to enable our customers to form their own partnerships with these vendors as quickly as possible.

Given the progress we made in 2024, partnerships conversations currently under way, and partnership opportunities in front of us next year, we’re confident that we’ll continue to accomplish this goal.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
