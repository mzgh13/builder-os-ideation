For many SaaS companies, product integrations are helpful—but not essential.

Their competitors might not offer product integrations; their customers might not demand them; and their prospects might not treat them as a key criteria when evaluating vendors.

HR software companies don’t fall into this category.

They _have to_ provide product integrations. Even more, they have to provide them across multiple categories of software.

You can read on to learn why.

### **Different integration categories support separate and uniquely-critical product functionality**

There are several categories of integrations that have a significant impact on an HR software provider’s UX—and neglecting any can come at a steep cost.

Let’s highlight two categories of integrations that illustrate this point: HRIS and accounting.

When HR software providers offer additional product lines, they’ll likely need to offer integrations with customers’ HRIS solutions to drive quick and seamless adoption with them.

[![A screenshot of BambooHR's ancillary products](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddcb23561b6230444df_AD_4nXddsZ2W-PVZbaoqhgJ-fXToFeVSwOZ6R8SyV8PDySfkmRk75M_lQRaUxKPDceqWgrG7KT5j3Yu-DbfyT05SIWR3zjbKZ5JQCoYtTRTBmSeYB2L0W6g_sJiaaUgAk72Wkb4NpGgE.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddcb23561b6230444df_AD_4nXddsZ2W-PVZbaoqhgJ-fXToFeVSwOZ6R8SyV8PDySfkmRk75M_lQRaUxKPDceqWgrG7KT5j3Yu-DbfyT05SIWR3zjbKZ5JQCoYtTRTBmSeYB2L0W6g_sJiaaUgAk72Wkb4NpGgE.webp)

More specifically, using these HRIS integrations, the HR software provider can auto-provision users to and de-provision users from their additional product based on the associated activities in the [integrated HRIS](https://www.merge.dev/blog/guide-to-hris-api-integrations).

[![auto-provisioning for HR product](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759d45f34edde4082082c5f_6759d42cf41b8ee1e4d79c88_inline%2520image%25201%2520(4).webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759d45f34edde4082082c5f_6759d42cf41b8ee1e4d79c88_inline%2520image%25201%2520(4).webp)

Accounting integrations also support several essential use cases.

For instance, once an HR provider integrates with customers’ accounting systems, they can build the following workflow: Once the HR provider processes payroll for a customer and creates a payroll journal entry, the entry will get added to the customer’s ERP system’s general ledger automatically, which can include key information (e.g., payment date) necessary to reconcile the expense.

[![POSTing payroll journal entries to customers' ERP systems](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759c037c665981b15e321cd_6759bf8a7b779d2cebde397a_inline%2520image%25202.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759c037c665981b15e321cd_6759bf8a7b779d2cebde397a_inline%2520image%25202.webp)

### **Market-leading HR software providers offer several categories of integrations**

Upstart and mid-sized HR solutions are at a significant disadvantage if they can’t keep pace with the market leading platforms’ integration offerings.

Take BambooHR, for example.

The market leading HR software offers nearly 150 product integrations that span countless categories, from accounting solutions to business communication platforms to applicant tracking systems.

[![The integration categories BambooHR support](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddda485e84181da3c76_AD_4nXek4JB7HAH4kC1QTb06Jc-tE01hn7q03q10ItHigyUXxp7FIecDm5pCMTEIYhS3XYPLnNU2lOg3bS9DTEWLY7JQDiZBxX6sq2y7-_3wt7N94UVB4SJnxVdjWd2_rYCFjpmjrdj5ow.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddda485e84181da3c76_AD_4nXek4JB7HAH4kC1QTb06Jc-tE01hn7q03q10ItHigyUXxp7FIecDm5pCMTEIYhS3XYPLnNU2lOg3bS9DTEWLY7JQDiZBxX6sq2y7-_3wt7N94UVB4SJnxVdjWd2_rYCFjpmjrdj5ow.webp)

_BambooHR lists out all of their integrations in_ [_their integration marketplace_](https://www.bamboohr.com/integrations/all-apps)

If HR software can’t offer the integrations BambooHR provides in key categories, they’ll be all the more likely to lose sales and customers to BambooHR—along with similar solutions that offer expansive integrations.

### **Cross-category integrations provide endless marketing opportunities**

Each customer-facing integration that an HR company adds is an opportunity to co-market with the other company across channels.

Take the HR software startup, Gifted.co—a gifting solution for clients and employees—as an example.

By integrating with Remote, a prominent HRIS solution, Gifted.co has been able to:

- Partner on a joint press release

[![Joint press release with Gifted.co and Remote](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc2ea0a1b74528c312_AD_4nXcJ89uu5ldoCWNZSHlGhPvTcSrqGl2uzwmis2gN6JAtQrG6ttw9Ghs9wYh0eQ-lEohOgtirPmRHqaYW7N76Jyeep78wE1Aj6Q7EvUI0s5RlAcCH45Mr66PGWc9Hdf09pc1FKSv62Q.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc2ea0a1b74528c312_AD_4nXcJ89uu5ldoCWNZSHlGhPvTcSrqGl2uzwmis2gN6JAtQrG6ttw9Ghs9wYh0eQ-lEohOgtirPmRHqaYW7N76Jyeep78wE1Aj6Q7EvUI0s5RlAcCH45Mr66PGWc9Hdf09pc1FKSv62Q.webp)

_Gifted and Remote’s joint press release announcement on their integration was covered in several relevant media outlets, including_ [_HR TechCube_](https://hrtechcube.com/gifted-co-and-remote-partner-to-boost-global-employee-engagement/)

- Have Remote promote the integration on their social channels (which have a significant following)

[![Remote amplifying Gifted.co's announcement](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc991c6af15d06bf3e_AD_4nXdLs7gnMmADX1J0YK3ahP6zzWqtN7He8xQrhimcZwOoZJOBhOq5Jk_WrlFblNZR4bBocNF09R59bV66z0EV6UjyKewoqffst_A-tjmqts_lRE9jx-W-KQeiUN9KAs9sivlSzLZ6MA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc991c6af15d06bf3e_AD_4nXdLs7gnMmADX1J0YK3ahP6zzWqtN7He8xQrhimcZwOoZJOBhOq5Jk_WrlFblNZR4bBocNF09R59bV66z0EV6UjyKewoqffst_A-tjmqts_lRE9jx-W-KQeiUN9KAs9sivlSzLZ6MA.webp)

- Establish a presence on Remote’s help center, with an article that walks users through setting up their integration with the HRIS solution.

[![Article on setting up the Gifted.co integration in Remote's help center](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc7b779d2cebdd6a2c_AD_4nXcMXHTe8ZzBgQb1XMjTET_7wq7Fl7RxnR1BuyHnM0A2eoAJtkr6pHL0_sZrf-KelZa6KMBeVNAw6MNrXS0ZzOKx9b1ih5fQb7AJ1GQ3y2DdEe4GsjbYRbG0Rqyp48AsnMvcBEcJrg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6759bddc7b779d2cebdd6a2c_AD_4nXcMXHTe8ZzBgQb1XMjTET_7wq7Fl7RxnR1BuyHnM0A2eoAJtkr6pHL0_sZrf-KelZa6KMBeVNAw6MNrXS0ZzOKx9b1ih5fQb7AJ1GQ3y2DdEe4GsjbYRbG0Rqyp48AsnMvcBEcJrg.webp)

It’s worth remembering: All of these activities are with _a single partner_.

If gifted.co can perform similar activities with popular software solutions across all of the integration categories they support (which includes marketing and sales), they have countless  opportunities to drive additional awareness.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
