The fintech space is growing exponentially.

Case in point: The number of fintech startups around the globe have more than doubled over the past five years ( [from 12k to 26k](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fintech-stats)).

Given the growth in the space, each fintech company increasingly needs to adopt and apply product principles that can differentiate their platforms over time.

To help you figure out the ones you should adopt, we asked 3 fast-growing fintech startups—Acctual, Basis, and Causal—about the principles that guide their product decisions and investments.

You can read on to see what they shared.

## **Treat product usage behavior as the ultimate source of truth**

[Acctual](https://www.acctual.com/), a stablecoin billing and invoicing software, needs to provide an intuitive UX so that customers can create invoices and pay bills quickly and without any issues.

As they watched how users leveraged their platform, however, they found that users were consistently running into an issue within their invoice creation workflow.

More specifically, the users didn’t know they had to create a contact first, which led them to receive error messages when they populated the rest of the invoice fields and tried to create it. This became a frustration for customers and led many of them to leave the platform to build the invoice elsewhere.

To tackle this, their team unbundled the contact creation and invoice creation workflow. Their team also made it more explicit within the UI that adding a contact is an action that needs to happen before creating an invoice. Taken together, they've significantly reduced the number of issues users face with the workflow.

[![Screenshot of customer creation workflow in Acctual](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679d205c5d040a16bc65de3d_AD_4nXf1_lUn2lO41_n330xPNtKN-t_OLuQDeVKy7Xd8ocer-h_pMbgaP3X0ZlBlqbH4bSuPpSKekMKbUlOZFKrpsOCZMJ-Kwp2qqnkYdk97hrdGcZeeUW4lGHAQYzNCA0CXRzSqJdoDHA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679d205c5d040a16bc65de3d_AD_4nXf1_lUn2lO41_n330xPNtKN-t_OLuQDeVKy7Xd8ocer-h_pMbgaP3X0ZlBlqbH4bSuPpSKekMKbUlOZFKrpsOCZMJ-Kwp2qqnkYdk97hrdGcZeeUW4lGHAQYzNCA0CXRzSqJdoDHA.webp)

_Actual’s customers are prompted to create a customer, or contact, before creating an invoice for them_

Issa Hassan’s—Actual’s CTO and co-founder—takeaway from this experience is that there’s simply no replacing the efficiency of monitoring actual customer behavior:

“We’ve learned that ten minutes spent watching a couple of users interact with a feature can provide far more insight than hours of back-and-forth internal communication. _Seeing users' frustrations and pain points first-hand also builds customer empathy.”_

## **Adopt a systems-first mindset to build a future-proof product**

A core product philosophy at [Basis](https://www.getbasis.ai/), an AI assistant for accounting firms, is building systems instead of point solutions.

For example, Basis has built a unified data architecture that’s designed to generalize context across accounting processes. This allows their AI agents to take on entirely new workflows without having to “reinvent the wheel.”

Mitchell Troyanovsky, one of Basis’ co-founders, adds more context for this example.

“Rather than addressing isolated problems with narrow, one-off tools, we’ve created a scalable foundation that adapts to a variety of inter-related accounting workflows. This ensures that _Basis solves today’s problems and can evolve to meet future challenges.”_

## **Provide seamless integrations to your product**

For [Causal](https://www.causal.app/)—a financial planning platform recently acquired by Lucanet—accessing and using customer data is table stakes.

Customer data (from systems like CRMs, HRISs, and ERPs) can power a wide range of financial models in Causal, whether that’s related to profit and loss statements, headcount planning, or burn rate forecasts.

[![Causal's integration marketplace](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679d205c1f515901df20cc20_AD_4nXc0kzm5hZcyPt923d5csyJ1KQrZgXabQvQ8zjJrqpsCaVYPu3LntkpjlLE_2fkbVmJpMFPQpiQ9hLXRVsUSETC3Jh0LfUIisLLifXQHpHwuuZDWgb5rKesTtKNCmZjfhS4z1v3RZg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/679d205c1f515901df20cc20_AD_4nXc0kzm5hZcyPt923d5csyJ1KQrZgXabQvQ8zjJrqpsCaVYPu3LntkpjlLE_2fkbVmJpMFPQpiQ9hLXRVsUSETC3Jh0LfUIisLLifXQHpHwuuZDWgb5rKesTtKNCmZjfhS4z1v3RZg.webp)

_Causal's product integrations are pivotal to enabling a fast time to value_

However, Causal needed to be mindful of how they offered their integrations. More specifically, putting the onus on customers to export files from their systems and import them into Causal was a poor user experience.

Lukas Koebis, Causal’s CTO and co-founder, adds more context on the issues of using [file-based integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/flat-file-integration) and what they did instead:

“Instead of asking clients to manually import their data to our product over time, which is extremely time consuming and tedious for clients, we wanted to automatically sync their data with our product; _offering API-based integrations with clients’ applications allow us to do just that.”_

## **Final thoughts**

While it’s important that every fintech company adopts inspiring and forward-thinking product principles, it’s even more critical that they’re willing to make the resource investments necessary to successfully apply them every day.

The fintechs that do the latter most effectively over time are likely to come out on top, no matter how crowded their market gets.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
