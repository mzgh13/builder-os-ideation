Nango offers a unified API that lets you integrate your product with hundreds of applications, including ATS solutions, accounting platforms, HR software, and more.

To evaluate the platform effectively and determine whether it’s the right integration solution for your business, we’ll break down their pricing works.

## **Overview on Nango’s pricing strategy**

Nango offers 3 pricing plans: Free, Growth, and Enterprise.

[![Nango's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682ca4fe08d5258246e435aa_AD_4nXd7vvmNhPjMeCZAFT4gtmn9YTsXrcKIwuRAL_vVpNNAZ_SpmC6-TYw-P_cgE23q-wFre9itM71uqodzK9V10y_3W398xZPZUJUDEdCp8BXKLSYiA0rAYXcHQ7RycF4WTgO5QjbQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682ca4fe08d5258246e435aa_AD_4nXd7vvmNhPjMeCZAFT4gtmn9YTsXrcKIwuRAL_vVpNNAZ_SpmC6-TYw-P_cgE23q-wFre9itM71uqodzK9V10y_3W398xZPZUJUDEdCp8BXKLSYiA0rAYXcHQ7RycF4WTgO5QjbQ.png)

Their free plan is extremely limited. You can’t access any of Nango’s integrations directly; you can just use their authorization functionality.

Since you likely need a solution like Nango to scale your customer-facing integrations, it’s hard to imagine this plan [meeting your integration needs](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-requirements).

Their Growth plan has a fixed monthly price of $50 and also includes variable pricing based on the number of customers that adopt your integrations ($1 per account per month), the number of requests that happen across your integrations ($.01 per request), and the volume of records that get synced ($.002 per monthly active record).

The Growth plan also offers several add-ons, such as the ability to sync data faster than every hour and adding SAML SSO for any employees who need to use your account.

Finally, their Enterprise plan includes everything from their Free and Growth plans as well as more advanced integration syncing and management capabilities, like access to external webhooks and the ability to export API logs. And it includes custom pricing for the variable components: each customer that adopts an integration, every API request, and each record that’s synced.

## **Pros and cons of Nango’s pricing strategy**

Here are some of the benefits of Nango’s pricing model:

- **The Growth plan includes a free trial.** This lets you pressure test their integrations, observability capabilities, support team, and more

- **Access white-labeled end-user guides across plans.** This provides a more seamless UX for users and—since users won’t know that a 3rd-party is involved—helps prevent any anxieties associated with using the integrations

- **Request new APIs relatively easily.** Whether you’re on the Growth or Enterprise plan, you can work with the Nango team on adding new integrations

Here are some drawbacks to consider:

- **Their free trial isn't straightforward.** Based on customer conversations, we've learned that their free trial still involves an infrastructure investment, which can prove expensive and resource intensive for your team to manage. Case in point, the CTO of [Twine](https://twine.com/), a product intelligence platform, shared the following insight with us:

##### “Merge lets you test their platform and validate your use case before making any significant code investment, while Nango requires an initial infrastructure investment.”

- **Complex pricing that’s difficult to forecast.** There are several variables that directly impact your costs (customers, API requests, records). Predicting how much of each you’ll need over time can be an incredibly difficult exercise, making it hard to assess whether the platform is worth the investment

[![Nano's pricing for Actions and Syncs](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682ca4fe01a0fac772729af0_AD_4nXcp_kJzVFEiDLXqp6jtAF6dlzfJ2o0aBXID6MnwtDA6Q2WKGOa7d1ZIPerNNJIWgMjGWAmtAsjVIfRni3cWYcBXpTqjJvm2dK1P9koGwT60EHMksVukhYGVQ0R6OGlYQnYJiC9J7Q.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682ca4fe01a0fac772729af0_AD_4nXcp_kJzVFEiDLXqp6jtAF6dlzfJ2o0aBXID6MnwtDA6Q2WKGOa7d1ZIPerNNJIWgMjGWAmtAsjVIfRni3cWYcBXpTqjJvm2dK1P9koGwT60EHMksVukhYGVQ0R6OGlYQnYJiC9J7Q.png)

_“Syncs” is especially difficult to predict, as it depends on the volume of data your customers need to sync_

- **Purchasing several add-ons will likely be inevitable.** For example, in the case of sync speed, you’ll be forced into purchasing their “Fast syncing” add-on if you want to sync data more often than once per hour. And if you need to sync data in real-time via webhooks, you’ll need to purchase a separate add-on

- **Lackluster support model.** You’ll only get “Expert advice for Enterprise APIs” on their enterprise plan. Given how complex integrations can be to manage (even if you use a 3rd-party solution like Nango) and the fact that you’ll likely need to integrate with enterprise apps like NetSuite and Workday, your team can be forced into purchasing their Enterprise plan just for this support

## **How Merge addresses these drawbacks**

Merge, the leading unified API solution, neatly addresses the top drawbacks of Nango’s pricing plans by:

- **Offering an easy way to predict costs:** You don’t need to think about the volume of data that’s synced or the number of API requests you need to make. You’ll only pay a fixed amount on one of Merge’s plans.

Note: If you’re on our Launch plan, the only variable cost is the number of customers that adopt the integrations.

- **Providing frequent syncs across plans.** For example, you can access [Merge’s webhooks](https://docs.merge.dev/basics/webhooks/merge-webhooks/) on every plan to sync data in real-time

- **Delivering enterprise-grade support.** Customers on Merge’s Professional and Enterprise plans get a dedicated customer success manager, access to a solution architect, and a Slack channel for receiving quick support. This level of support not only ensures that your integrations are kept healthy but also lets you navigate difficult go-to-market considerations (e.g., “How do I price my integrations?”) successfully.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
