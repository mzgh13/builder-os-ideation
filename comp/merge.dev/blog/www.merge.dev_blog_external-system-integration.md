As you look to delight clients and attract new business, you likely have a variety of levers to pull from; this includes anything from pricing changes to product enhancements.

Based on [buyer’s purchasing criteria](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/digital-markets/documents/ebook-global-software-buyer-trends-survey-insights-for-2022.pdf), [product integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations)—otherwise referred to as external system integrations—should also be top of mind.

We’ll walk through everything you need to know about external system integrations; this includes the use cases they can support, the benefits they provide, and a way to build them. But first, let’s align on its definition.

## **What is external system integration?**

It’s any integration that’s built between your product and a 3rd-party API. These integrations can be built in-house or through a 3rd-party solution.

_Related:_ [_A guide to native integrations_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/native-integrations)

## **Examples of external system integration**

Here are just a few powerful external integration use cases:

### **Automate user provisioning**

Asking clients to provision and deprovision users in your product manually can quickly turn into a nightmare.

These activities are extremely time intensive to perform at scale, and they’re bound to cause issues for clients. For example, your clients may forget to provision certain users and/or fail to deprovision former employees.

To save your clients time and to ensure employees are provisioned and deprovisioned correctly, you can integrate your product with clients’ HRIS solutions and build the following [auto-provisioning workflow](https://www.merge.dev/blog/automated-provisioning): Once an employee in an HRIS is added or removed from the HRIS, they are also added or removed from your product. Similarly, if certain employee fields in the HRIS change, these changes can get reflected in their corresponding profile in your product (which can potentially alter their level of permissions in your product).

[![A visual breakdown of automating employee onboarding and offboarding with your product](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655237fe20abb909b12400d5_UfZvAzsk1Wet8hz_ep4GGn_urkFZ-pYvbcZIPONrKdVubAMdAF7gFN3qpkKCXJOXmN_LzPuj056TbCeqKf7qmiEoQVWVQqYyQ88zwwAzsnHnjvxAC5rknYXliV0tB-LtoOAPT2ddRfEewzdP3Im0tBg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655237fe20abb909b12400d5_UfZvAzsk1Wet8hz_ep4GGn_urkFZ-pYvbcZIPONrKdVubAMdAF7gFN3qpkKCXJOXmN_LzPuj056TbCeqKf7qmiEoQVWVQqYyQ88zwwAzsnHnjvxAC5rknYXliV0tB-LtoOAPT2ddRfEewzdP3Im0tBg.webp)

### **Add new leads to clients’ marketing automation platforms seamlessly**

Let’s say you offer an event management platform that—in addition to hosting events—helps you promote any event and collect registrants.

To help your clients nurture event registrant leads effectively, you can [integrate your product with their marketing automation solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/marketing-automation-integration).

[![Event management flow](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654a9cccf5ea9d4cc9ad9626_TiYayzJAvuDRMq5tc3iMQZAoGIclL9Up8WqUjaO5ZDHlDZ96272AyPkAV9WttS9wyKpB0Ct_t1heSxVmc-WFE7-Y0yWFdbZwuKpePem7GvGa9jFFkeLY3jk4U9ys4eTFlccRot-ODHFkQBKEhjyAwdU.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654a9cccf5ea9d4cc9ad9626_TiYayzJAvuDRMq5tc3iMQZAoGIclL9Up8WqUjaO5ZDHlDZ96272AyPkAV9WttS9wyKpB0Ct_t1heSxVmc-WFE7-Y0yWFdbZwuKpePem7GvGa9jFFkeLY3jk4U9ys4eTFlccRot-ODHFkQBKEhjyAwdU.webp)

As part of the integration, you can sync specific information that the prospect provides, like their full name, company name, why they’re interested in the event, etc. Your marketing team can then use these insights to nurture the leads even more effectively (e.g. segmenting them by the topics they’re interested in and adding them to nurture campaigns that are tailored to their areas of interest).

### **Create candidates in clients’ ATS solutions automatically**

Now, let’s imagine you offer a solution that helps recruiters identify strong candidates for open roles.

Instead of forcing recruiters to add these candidates to their ATS solutions manually, you can [integrate your product with clients’ ATS solutions](https://www.merge.dev/blog/guide-to-ats-api-integrations) and implement the following sync: Once a candidate is recommended in your product and the recruiter approves it (e.g. they click an “Approved” button in your product's UI), the candidate gets added to the ATS solution.

Specific fields, like the candidate’s full name, job title, and employer, can also get added to their ATS profile instantly, all but ensuring that your recruiters have all the context they need to reach out.

[![A visual breakdown of automating candidate sourcing](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655237fef6b9064f3f8ac9d4_e3r0GME0AEdw1BS42nCqzLZ83spknylf_lbbwpOTmJgsClMvlaYO-eK_aH4QY2tKUSl2zlaEIK_9eF3nImzRDi8ujlsLgYOioh52r8acGtb_orKslv1zgSAUvbYZPM8e_r4_SWKdOHPXWFV4mlQr-Kg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/655237fef6b9064f3f8ac9d4_e3r0GME0AEdw1BS42nCqzLZ83spknylf_lbbwpOTmJgsClMvlaYO-eK_aH4QY2tKUSl2zlaEIK_9eF3nImzRDi8ujlsLgYOioh52r8acGtb_orKslv1zgSAUvbYZPM8e_r4_SWKdOHPXWFV4mlQr-Kg.webp)

## **External system integration benefits**

Here are some of the benefits of external system integration:

### **Enhances the customer experience**

As you can tell from our examples, external system integrations can help clients avoid tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone tasks. This allows them to focus on more high value ways to leverage your product instead, which not only benefits them but also your chances of retaining their business.

### **Increases your close rate**

As mentioned earlier, buyers are often looking for solutions that provide seamless integrations with their other SaaS applications. If your product stands out in its integration offerings, you, therefore, have a higher chance of winning their business.

### **Expands your total addressable market**

Organizations across specific regions, industries, and sizes often rely on a specific set of applications in a given software category. For instance, a small business might use Gusto as their HRIS while an enterprise organization might use Workday.

If you can offer integrations that cater to the markets you’d like to expand into, you’re likely to gain traction more easily.

### **Supports your product’s AI capabilities**

Building powerful and personalized AI features in your product ultimately requires feeding your AI engine a high volume of data from clients’ applications over time.

External system integrations can help support exactly that, whether it’s getting data from clients’ CRM systems, HRIS solutions, ticketing tools, file storage applications, etc.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
