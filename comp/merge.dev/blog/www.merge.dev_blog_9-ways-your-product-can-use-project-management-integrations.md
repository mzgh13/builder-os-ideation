Whether your customers use project management software like Asana, internal ticketing systems like Jira, or customer service platforms like Zendesk - providing deep [integrations with project management software](https://www.merge.dev/categories-old/ticketing-api) can bring your product to the next level.

# **What can you do with project management integrations?**

If you want to connect to your users' project management platform, Merge can support it. Here are some ideas:

**Ensure Security Compliance**: Open a [ticket](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) and add an [attachment](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/attachments) to create a record of permission changes in your customer’s Asana.

**Kick off a Task**: Create a [ticket](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) directly within your app - e.g., create a ticket within your customer’s Asana as soon as you detect a security issue

**Streamline Communication**: Read and post [comments](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/comments) and [attachments](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/attachments) on a [ticket](https://merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) within your product - e.g. Add a comment about a candidate to your customer’s Asana.

**Alert Team Members**: List [teams](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/teams) and [users](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/users) so your product can be aware of who to notify about updates - e.g., send an update to your customer’s engineering team in ClickUp about the state of their current sprint

**Speed Up Onboarding Tasks:** Onboarding - especially for remote-first workspaces - takes up to [three months](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/how-long-should-onboarding-take/#:~:text=The%20general%20consensus%20among%20HR,an%20employee's%20entire%20first%20year). How much of that time is spent manually checking and assigning tasks?

By automatically generating tickets to complete tasks related to onboarding, your customers can increase the value of their business 10x.

**Know the Real-Time Status of Projects and Tasks** \- Provide real-time data with the combination of Merge’s webhooks and Merge’s [Ticket](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) object - which provides a helpful “status” field to let you know whether a ticket is open or closed.

**Integrate with Other PM Apps —** When 73% of businesses want better ease of integration between ticketing apps then it’s best to list. Allow for the reading and writing of [Tickets](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) across a dozen systems with Merge’s Unified API.

**Offer Time Tracking** \- Read data about when a [Ticket](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets) was created to provide valuable information about the time spent on each project.

**Track Bugs Anywhere** \- Want to provide a single source of truth for how customer success and engineering squash bugs? Read info from [Tickets](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tickets), [Tags](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/tags), and [Teams](https://www.merge.dev/docs/ticketing/teams) to reliably sort info related to customer-specific bugs.

–

And that’s just the start.

Merge provides more than a Unified API for Project Management. We offer integrations with 100+ other [HR and Payroll](https://www.merge.dev/categories-old/hr-payroll-api), [ATS/recruiting](https://www.merge.dev/categories-old/ats-recruiting-api), and [accounting systems](https://www.merge.dev/categories-old/accounting-api), CRM systems.

Whether your product needs additional integrations now or in the future, you know you can count on Merge.

Don’t see your use case above? [Schedule time](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2F9-ways-your-product-can-use-project-management-integrations) with one of the members of our sales team: they’re here to talk you through your use case and determine if Merge is the right fit.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
