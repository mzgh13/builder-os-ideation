Codat lets FinServ companies add dozens of integrations to their platforms to support a variety of use cases—such as provisioning corporate cards and generating financial reports.

To suss out whether the [universal API platform](https://www.merge.dev/blog/universal-api) is right for your business, you’ll need to understand their pricing model. We’ll help you do just that by walking through how their pricing works and potential issues to consider.

## **Codat pricing overview**

Codat doesn’t provide any pricing details on their website. You’ll need to schedule time with their team if you want any pricing-related information.

[![Codat's form to get in touch with their team](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5d654baada79634983_AD_4nXfkfEY5xYDSjNbCXoN_nm1xebcn25V_T5U6zozdS29tYQsoMw4Tvo9VRVi0sZpMr5b0JsRkrtJhhc6i_rYaREM_P53EhCpsGTPgGrPTl7K0tTT_SC_mJ9YgIRA8fd4LVHZ_Rn_O.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5d654baada79634983_AD_4nXfkfEY5xYDSjNbCXoN_nm1xebcn25V_T5U6zozdS29tYQsoMw4Tvo9VRVi0sZpMr5b0JsRkrtJhhc6i_rYaREM_P53EhCpsGTPgGrPTl7K0tTT_SC_mJ9YgIRA8fd4LVHZ_Rn_O.png)

_Codat requires you to fill out a form and speak to their team to learn more about their pricing options_

That said, in the past they’ve included two items as part of their pricing model and likely still do so:

- **Platform fee:** a fixed yearly fee for accessing their platform
- **Linked accounts:** a variable charge that’s priced per established connection. For example, if one of Codat’s end users (a customer’s customer) uses a Codat-powered integration, that’s considered a linked account

## **Drawbacks of Codat’s pricing model**

Here are the top issues to consider.

### **Lack of transparency**

Since Codat doesn’t list their pricing online, they could easily price discriminate, or vary their pricing solely based on the prospect they’re speaking to.

You’re also forced to spend time speaking with a sales rep.

During this conversation, you might learn that they’re too expensive or that their pricing model won't scale in a way that’s cost-effective. You could have learned either fact in seconds if their pricing details were listed on their site.

### **Relying on incomplete information from 3rd-parties**

If you wanted to determine their pricing independently, you’d have to use 3rd-party sources that may not be up to date, comprehensive, or personalized to your needs.

Vendr, for example, lets you review Codat’s pricing, but they’re relying on a sample size of 3 purchases.

‍

[![How Vendr displays Codat's pricing](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5d65e018990bba41cd_AD_4nXfWtJE6fygYL-PrgYe8S6DZR9HtGG06A8L4fZGkcpZ7-jBgn6MORiCHImpFZ8yFo_ZX2VO0ERk52O1ExJ7MeWS1pUD-KnsBS81RKZUJpUiNQh-aRtbLQb9Q8_Fx6WAgcrK7jge_Bg.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5d65e018990bba41cd_AD_4nXfWtJE6fygYL-PrgYe8S6DZR9HtGG06A8L4fZGkcpZ7-jBgn6MORiCHImpFZ8yFo_ZX2VO0ERk52O1ExJ7MeWS1pUD-KnsBS81RKZUJpUiNQh-aRtbLQb9Q8_Fx6WAgcrK7jge_Bg.png)

Vendr also doesn’t provide any details, such as how Codat’s pricing varies across its plans; they’re just sharing a broad price range.

### **Unclear support model**

Aside from the financials, Codat also doesn’t share how much support they’re willing to provide at a given subscription level.

This is likely critical information for your evaluation, as you’ll need to understand Codat’s SLAs, go-to-market support, and more to get a sense of whether the company can be a trusted, long-term integration partner.

It’s also worth noting that several of our customers who evaluated and/or tried Codat were disappointed with their support.

For example, Kara Holinski, the CTO and co-founder of Confido, a financial operations software for CPG, had this to say:

“We used Codat for a few months, but the support was not that helpful and they would get back to us in a week.”

## **Merge provides clear and comprehensive pricing details**

Merge, the leading unified API solution, details its plans—Launch, Professional, and Enterprise—on its site comprehensively.

[![Merge's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5ea6f05469511b04ea_AD_4nXeAst-5Ax9wAdzPIAykqC3D9i3lnFZHmPiQkA2YkquHDUSQPHCFYdxgk3m7tnigKyrM8JukAC1q1hB_kWMbvT1xj8QqeFjSrvy4m6tB90yf9XFkSecAUF3GZtN3N9YTJ4f9MDOuRw.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67eaed5ea6f05469511b04ea_AD_4nXeAst-5Ax9wAdzPIAykqC3D9i3lnFZHmPiQkA2YkquHDUSQPHCFYdxgk3m7tnigKyrM8JukAC1q1hB_kWMbvT1xj8QqeFjSrvy4m6tB90yf9XFkSecAUF3GZtN3N9YTJ4f9MDOuRw.png)

As part of these pricing plans, Merge also outlines the level of support they're able to offer (e.g., “Premium go-live support”), the enterprise security features they provide (e.g., Audit Trail), whether they can provide you with access to sandbox accounts for testing integrations, and more.

Merge will likely also do a better job of meeting your integration needs by supporting:

- Integration categories that extend beyond accounting—such as HRIS, ticketing, and file storage
- Features to help you access and sync custom accounting data
- Instant POST requests (Codat’s POST requests run async, leading to delayed data updates)

Learn more about why Merge is the better integration partner for your business by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fcodat-pricing).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
