Building product integrations, or integrations between your platform and your customers’ applications, isn’t a choice; they offer business-critical benefits, from improving customer retention to increasing your close rate to helping you expand to new markets.

[![A bar chart that shows the benefits of offering integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66421783475484b950013cd1_BWrIP6ac3_9te43GcgGG0SzUPNIi6cZo3P9SHfly7LbDGL1vd0PM9nbm3JsMuU-sTvGKCsTbVZf9o0a2KJtC1Nzjx0nyx89QqgiML2cOE0Vxn2Q3KnrXfcewmQXlVds2iLXytX5aOgcaaCtzeQ_QM08.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66421783475484b950013cd1_BWrIP6ac3_9te43GcgGG0SzUPNIi6cZo3P9SHfly7LbDGL1vd0PM9nbm3JsMuU-sTvGKCsTbVZf9o0a2KJtC1Nzjx0nyx89QqgiML2cOE0Vxn2Q3KnrXfcewmQXlVds2iLXytX5aOgcaaCtzeQ_QM08.webp)

_More than half of the SaaS organizations we surveyed for our_ [_State of Product Integrations report_](https://www.merge.dev/learning/state-of-product-integrations-2024) _said they’ve realized the benefits highlighted above_

However, deciding whether to “buy” or “build” integrations isn’t always a clear-cut decision. Each approach has pros and cons, and every pro and con can carry more weight for some organizations and less weight for others.

To help you evaluate these two options effectively, we’ll align on how each of them work, break down their respective pros and cons, and then compare them directly.

## **Overview on building integrations**

Building integrations simply refers to a company enlisting their engineers with [implementing and maintaining customer-facing integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/customer-facing-integration).

These in-house engineers are on the hook for understanding the API providers’ endpoints, constructing the API requests, testing the connections, implementing the infrastructure to handle the responses successfully (e.g., adopting specific error-handling workflows), and more.

[![visual of building integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66421783937c973f83124e49_A_-7B0PbKA0OiyO1cCHEE37rwPZfVsRLRrlHILp4pD0zNizKxhqAtOzp8NGv57uefq9y_HU-GOHGqSsWTJyg8r5CQk1q5fVjZpmcP-iRicaTxhpKPnYMGb6Cmx8il_fhmvjnHMNHWyIVdPx6bD2Dhds.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66421783937c973f83124e49_A_-7B0PbKA0OiyO1cCHEE37rwPZfVsRLRrlHILp4pD0zNizKxhqAtOzp8NGv57uefq9y_HU-GOHGqSsWTJyg8r5CQk1q5fVjZpmcP-iRicaTxhpKPnYMGb6Cmx8il_fhmvjnHMNHWyIVdPx6bD2Dhds.webp)

### **Benefits of building integrations**

Here are some of the benefits of building integrations:

- Lets you avoid investing in 3rd-party integration tooling
- Allows you to [customize the integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/custom-api-integration) to your specific use cases
- Gives your team full control over identifying and resolving integration issues as they arise

### **Drawbacks of building integrations**

Unfortunately, building integrations come with several issues:

- Forces your engineers to invest significant time in not only building integrations but also in maintaining them—which is never-ending work
- Lowers engineering morale, as every time an integration breaks, affected customers and team members will voice their frustration with the engineers, even when the fault lies with a 3rd-party API provider
- Scaling your integrations requires you to hire more engineers and invest further in your infrastructure

## **Overview on buying integrations**

Buying integrations is investing in a 3rd-party platform that lets you add integrations to your product. Depending on the vendor, this can also include integration maintenance support and observability tooling.

[![Buying integrations screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66e07a2c59ddf27a5de63941_6642182fb6c04fa763a030a8_Screenshot%25202024-05-13%2520at%25209.39.45%25E2%2580%25AFAM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66e07a2c59ddf27a5de63941_6642182fb6c04fa763a030a8_Screenshot%25202024-05-13%2520at%25209.39.45%25E2%2580%25AFAM.webp)

_You can buy integrations from an embedded iPaaS or a unified API solution. The former forces you to build one integration at a time and requires users to have a technical background; the latter lets you build once to access hundreds of product integrations_

### **Benefits of buying integrations**

Here are just a few reasons to invest in a 3rd-party solution:

- Enables engineering to save significant time—which they can reallocate toward your core product
- The solution may offer powerful and accessible observability features, allowing customer-facing teams to identify, diagnose, and resolve integration issues independently
- You can leverage a wide range of reliable, secure, and comprehensive integrations out-of-the-box

### **Drawbacks of buying integrations**

There’s also a few potential issues to keep in mind:

- Depending on the vendor, the pricing model can be cost-prohibitive at scale
- The platform may force you to build one integration at a time and require users to have a technical background
- The platform may not cover the specific applications you need to connect to or the individual objects and fields you need to sync

Given all the pros and cons of both building and buying integrations, it can be hard to pick the approach that’s best for your business. To help you land on the best one, we've outlined general guidelines for making the decision in the next section.

_Related:_ [_A guide to 3rd-party integrations_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/3rd-party-integration)

### **Building vs buying an integration**

The decision depends on your integration’s requirements, available developer resources, and the level of control you want to have throughout the integration’s life span. However, it’s generally more cost-effective to buy an integration.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
