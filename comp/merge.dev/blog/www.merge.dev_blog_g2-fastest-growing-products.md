G2, the prominent software review site, features countless reviews on thousands of companies, giving them a unique perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of different SaaS organizations. This leads their annual award lists to be reliable, insightful, and prestigious.

Given this context, we’re thrilled to announce our debut in their list of [“Fastest Growing Products for 2024.”](https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/fastest-growing#list)

We see this recognition as a testament to all of the progress we’ve made with our product. And while there are a variety of new features and integrations that could have pushed us into this list, we’ll break down the ones we think influenced G2 the most.

### We launched Integration Observability, a suite of tools to help customer-facing teams manage clients’ integrations

We’ve built out a number of features—which make up what we refer to as Integration Observability—to help your customer success managers identify, troubleshoot, and resolve integration issues quickly, easily, and effectively.

For instance, we launched automated issue detection, which helps customer success managers pinpoint specific issues on the client’s end—along with the steps for remediating them (which we refer to as our “Detailed Error Messages”).

[![A screenshot of Merge's Issues dashboard](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c4166338b1172cab3494ed_WAFjdEgnahe4CtRasEVyENDpquPDlpx_dHP9nKZ9NoFo2vgV1j6wLNv0sf2NBiqSoVEXCbN8N2IR6uqB6uPb9Zam_xbFHfhHslrQ55F2Yly7zmij5CjZ9u8dZAgfgy6jstnmHdD3VUcqOWBMyMyl0CVWmcCrcEXGXiQkjtlarLFaG5xgmbMHUHGJMpxj8A.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c4166338b1172cab3494ed_WAFjdEgnahe4CtRasEVyENDpquPDlpx_dHP9nKZ9NoFo2vgV1j6wLNv0sf2NBiqSoVEXCbN8N2IR6uqB6uPb9Zam_xbFHfhHslrQ55F2Yly7zmij5CjZ9u8dZAgfgy6jstnmHdD3VUcqOWBMyMyl0CVWmcCrcEXGXiQkjtlarLFaG5xgmbMHUHGJMpxj8A.webp)

_Merge can automatically detect common issues and, for each, provide the steps for resolving it; your customer success managers can then pass along these steps to the affected clients._

We’ve also added fully-searchable logs that let your team uncover additional issues, like server-side errors.

And, last but not least, your customer success managers can now easily review the link statuses across their accounts (i.e., whether a client has successfully established an integration between your product and a 3rd-party application). More specifically, your customer success managers can see which accounts haven’t completed the linking flow or need to relink. This empowers your customer success managers to pinpoint the clients that need support and reach out on time—with the end-goal of minimizing integration downtime and accelerating the onboarding process.

### We expanded our unified API categories to include file storage and CRM

We’ve added several [file storage integrations](https://www.merge.dev/categories/file-storage-api) with prominent platforms, like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and SharePoint. And we’ve already seen our clients leverage these integrations in innovative and exciting ways.

For example, [Assembly](https://www.joinassembly.com/), which provides several HR solutions, uses their file storage integrations to automatically add clients’ files to their product. This allows their clients’ users to find all of the documents they need—and that fall within their level of permissions in their file storage app—without having to leave Assembly.

In addition, Dora AI, Assembly’s AI-powered search for their intranet solution, uses the information in clients’ files to provide useful and accurate responses when employees have any questions about their company (e.g., “What is my company’s PTO policy?”)

[![A screenshot of Dora AI answering a question](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c416fc38b1172cab352234_T0nf385KG1V15kzr4kRo0IFSynU4r7VJQX2KsocHW3qGV9tTL9b8vDQhJg4qO326TFhcZ6dJpIi1B7UH_uhPw4vf5zHdL-mSN7AUdT_YFN51PPfKgpUWzVjwf6_SN0s5xzK38QIpu7oOxnp7GdnOYJIQM_1ROeU3lfKpRYN2JoDScCrkETdKyKaUE9w0Bg.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c416fc38b1172cab352234_T0nf385KG1V15kzr4kRo0IFSynU4r7VJQX2KsocHW3qGV9tTL9b8vDQhJg4qO326TFhcZ6dJpIi1B7UH_uhPw4vf5zHdL-mSN7AUdT_YFN51PPfKgpUWzVjwf6_SN0s5xzK38QIpu7oOxnp7GdnOYJIQM_1ROeU3lfKpRYN2JoDScCrkETdKyKaUE9w0Bg.webp)

_Learn more about_ [_how Assembly uses Merge’s File Storage Unified API_](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/how-merge-unblocked-10x-in-sales-for-assembly) _._

We’ve also added [20+ CRM integrations](https://www.merge.dev/categories/crm-api) to power a variety of use cases for your product, from enhancing your analytics to helping you send timely and critical messages to sales reps.

For instance, [Telescope](https://trytelescope.ai/)—a sales automation solution that uses a machine learning algorithm to provide lead recommendations—can automatically add recommended leads to clients’ CRM systems through their CRM integrations; their clients can also sync additional data on each lead, such as the actions that have been taken on them in Telescope. Put together, sales managers and leadership are better positioned to understand their pipeline and coach reps on specific opportunities.

Moreover, Telescope can use each client's CRM data to train their machine learning algorithm, enabling Telescope to offer more relevant lead recommendations for each client.

_Discover additional ways that Telescope leverages their CRM integrations by visiting_ [_their case study_](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/telescope) _._

### We released Field Mapping to help your clients map their custom objects and fields to our Common Models

Your clients may occasionally have custom data in specific applications that’s critical to include and continuously sync in your product. To help clients address this need, we released Field Mapping.

Using Field Mapping, you can easily add custom, non-mapped data to the Common Models your clients use, allowing your application to then access and sync this data. You can even set up custom field mappings for each client with ease by using our Field Mapping via API feature (currently in closed-beta).

[![A screenshot of an example of Field Mapping](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c41722118d8a8efb90773d_OGvOlB2PdnYGkE8dfBwuYPSbJ44UewohYKrsPowv2-aKzvLfQBYE2GFs-pQ-z_uTKoPyIas2JgFyD1sN5uveMEq33vG4XzD2-q_3KZCuHGsVqls-NJLGNb9NHLcotUA_EQjNLBJG2zZRqxt0cSD273_8SfyXCVqAvv0drB8Ck-ck_7MjyKjrYb9w4DynZw.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65c41722118d8a8efb90773d_OGvOlB2PdnYGkE8dfBwuYPSbJ44UewohYKrsPowv2-aKzvLfQBYE2GFs-pQ-z_uTKoPyIas2JgFyD1sN5uveMEq33vG4XzD2-q_3KZCuHGsVqls-NJLGNb9NHLcotUA_EQjNLBJG2zZRqxt0cSD273_8SfyXCVqAvv0drB8Ck-ck_7MjyKjrYb9w4DynZw.webp)

_Using Field Mapping, you can hypothetically add the field “technical\_assessment\_score” to Merge’s Candidate Common Model._

And while the way Field Mapping works is fairly simple, it delivers outsized value to our clients.

Take [Ledgy](https://ledgy.com/), a leading European equity management software company, as an example.

They automate user provisioning through the HRIS integrations they’ve built via Merge, but they found that their clients don’t want all their employees to get added to Ledgy; only those who qualify for equity.

To filter for these employees, clients added a custom field in their HRIS that denotes whether the employee qualifies for equity. Using Field Mapping, Ledgy was able to add this field into their Employee Common Model. They then built a flow where any time the custom field is marked as “Yes” for a client’s employee, they would get added to Ledgy.

_See how Ledgy uses Field Mapping, and Merge more broadly, by_ [_reading their case study_](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/ledgy) _._

### Final thoughts

These new integrations and feature releases are just a few of the many we’ve launched over the past year, so it’s impossible to know what, exactly, led Merge to make it onto G2’s list.

Regardless, we’re thrilled that our clients are already adopting and seeing value from all of our new integrations and features. And we remain as committed as ever to invest in areas that allow our clients to provide more flexible, reliable, and powerful customer-facing integrations.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
