Gong, the leading revenue intelligence platform, has become an essential tool for sales reps, regardless of the products and services they sell.

Building such an impactful and beloved sales platform, however, wasn’t easy. It required Gong to adopt certain product principles that’d enable them to make bold decisions and navigate difficult trade offs successfully.

Eilon Reshef, Gong’s CPO and a co-founder, shares some of the product principles that’ve enabled their success in [our recent webinar](https://www.merge.dev/webinars/gong-product-principles).

You can read on to learn about a few of them.

### **Focus on delivering a fast time-to-value—especially when you’re just getting off the ground**

When Gong first launched, they knew they had to overcome reps’ initial hesitancy of having their sales calls recorded.

To help accomplish this, Gong’s product team doubled down on building features that would drive a fast time-to-value, build trust with sellers, and even be enjoyable to use.

Eilon explains this principle further:

### **Keep the product intuitive and enjoyable as you move upmarket**

As Gong moved upmarket and began selling to Fortune 50 organizations, they needed to add more configuration capabilities to their product, such as enabling admins to decide who can access certain features.

These configuration capabilities, however, couldn’t come at the expense of their user experience (UX).

Users, regardless of employer size, always want Gong to offer a clean and simple UX that consistently delights them.

Eilon elaborates:

### ‍ **Don’t sweat the ambiguous product decisions**

Many product decisions are incredibly difficult to make, even after you’ve received all of the relevant information.

Eilon argues that in these cases, it’s best to simply make a decision and move your attention elsewhere—so long as the decision isn’t irreversible.

But even then, you should pressure test whether a decision is irreversible, as, according to Eilon, 95% of the decisions that you think are irreversible at the moment aren’t.

Here’s more on Eilon’s approach to making decisions when they're unclear:

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
