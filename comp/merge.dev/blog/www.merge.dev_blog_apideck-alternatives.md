@Merge

As you look to scale your customer-facing integrations, you’ll likely come across Apideck, a unified API solution that offers customer-facing integrations for HRIS, CRM, accounting, and other categories of software.

Before deciding whether to move forward with the unified API vendor, it’s worth considering several other solutions.

We’ve rounded up the top ones worth considering below and broke down how each of them outperforms Apideck.

_Note: This article was written on 11/25/2024. All of the information presented below is subject to_

_change in the future._

## **Merge**

### **When to choose Paragon over Apideck**

- **You want to access a richer set of integrations.** Paragon supports several categories that Apideck doesn’t, such as content management, business intelligence, and advertising **‍**

_Related:_ [_Competitors to Paragon_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/paragon-alternatives)

## **Workato**

Like Paragon, Workato offers an embedded iPaaS solution to help organizations add a wide range of customer-facing integrations and automations to their products.
