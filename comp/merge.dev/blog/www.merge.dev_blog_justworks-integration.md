@Merge

Justworks, a professional employer organization (PEO) and payroll provider, helps 10,000+ small businesses in the U.S. with everything they need to manage a distributed global workforce.

Given the platform’s popularity, many of your customers likely use it and want your product to integrate with it.

To help support this, we’ve launched an official integration with Justworks!

### **How our official integration will help us support your Justworks integration**

Through our relationship, Merge also has a direct line of communication with Justworks’ developer support team. This means that if an issue comes up, we can work with them to resolve it quickly.

In addition, Merge will work with Justworks to maintain and support the integration so that you can focus on running your business.

### **An exciting milestone for Merge**

We’re committed to helping our customers add a reliable, secure, and performant Justworks integration to their products, and this official integration is just one step towards helping us achieve this aim.

You can learn more about our customer-facing Justworks integration by visiting [this page](https://www.merge.dev/integrations/justworks). And you can learn more about how you can leverage our unified API to not only integrate with Justworks but also 70+ other HRIS solutions by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fworkday-partnership).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
