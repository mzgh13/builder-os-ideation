As you look to connect applications and sync data, you’ll probably consider a few different approaches.

API integration and data integration likely top your list.

To help you determine which is better for a given integration scenario, we’ll break down how each one works by defining it and sharing some examples. We’ll then compare the approaches directly.

## **What is API integration?**

It involves connecting applications via their APIs. Once connected, these applications can sync specific data on a predefined, time-based interval or in near real-time.

### **Types of API integration**

You can implement two [types of API integration](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-integration-types): product integrations or internal integrations.

Internal API integrations are between the applications your teams use internally.

For instance, if your marketing team relies on Hubspot as its marketing automation platform and your sales team uses Salesforce as its CRM, you can connect the two systems and build a flow that routes leads from the former to the latter any time a lead reaches a certain score.

[![An example of an internal integration](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/657b4a24dc2d4e6aedd32abe_HIxFa38ukA5GZNWoUe1dtPUVNOwB4DOjjFEI4adNQUKy_h9uylTKe_9d7knuOlfDnERY5lD-hWFnSkrYaZ4zDbyitZF3Xon79jA_1iaXYxUUv349zCXS7ZtcjJHWbzemDECmqOwuXK_IZuojoPbMj94.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/657b4a24dc2d4e6aedd32abe_HIxFa38ukA5GZNWoUe1dtPUVNOwB4DOjjFEI4adNQUKy_h9uylTKe_9d7knuOlfDnERY5lD-hWFnSkrYaZ4zDbyitZF3Xon79jA_1iaXYxUUv349zCXS7ZtcjJHWbzemDECmqOwuXK_IZuojoPbMj94.webp)

[Product integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations), on the other hand, involve connecting your product with clients’ applications.

Say you provide a sales automation solution that can identify and recommend leads to clients. You can allow clients to connect your product with their CRM system so that they can add a recommended lead to their CRM in near real-time.

[![Illustration of customer-facing integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/657b4a2413bda3fe59787c4f_y4DgE21XpVKOgj4qCu367b3qrAqcoWSb4DiLyKyV0kTMraTm6JFz9GXb_Q1LmUEd96vrBfI5jATAyB9tktiFIvLAieMNVYdaP5OZCGdiiSxadGZgquholIQ59nChQohGzAuD_SvZLhsZn2TchKgTruI.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/657b4a2413bda3fe59787c4f_y4DgE21XpVKOgj4qCu367b3qrAqcoWSb4DiLyKyV0kTMraTm6JFz9GXb_Q1LmUEd96vrBfI5jATAyB9tktiFIvLAieMNVYdaP5OZCGdiiSxadGZgquholIQ59nChQohGzAuD_SvZLhsZn2TchKgTruI.webp)

## **What is data integration?**

Most equate it with the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process. This involves extracting data from various source systems, transforming the data to a specific data model, and then loading all of it into a data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake).

[![Data integration visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658076bf62cf5e684d4cbcba_5K5KYZHLVl0MMN4jsyIdZUwE_eTaMwj5nGrqoqk9JBSo8ZmxnwGgZGi6yVTelRsrxlpalw7L_oio7xh0P4bpE12jMKDbBk6OzC-b-j6uYFoxRTZOC6MsIpVJx9leoFfVR8JI1t1bb_Bp2l4Ee0T8Lso.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658076bf62cf5e684d4cbcba_5K5KYZHLVl0MMN4jsyIdZUwE_eTaMwj5nGrqoqk9JBSo8ZmxnwGgZGi6yVTelRsrxlpalw7L_oio7xh0P4bpE12jMKDbBk6OzC-b-j6uYFoxRTZOC6MsIpVJx9leoFfVR8JI1t1bb_Bp2l4Ee0T8Lso.webp)

The data in the data warehouse can then be synced with BI tools so that your analysts can leverage an accurate and diverse set of information.

### **Types of data integration**

Aside from ETL, you can associate data integration with reverse ETL and embedded reverse ETL.

Reverse ETL allows you to sync specific data from your data warehouse with individual downstream applications, allowing your employees to access the insights they need within the applications they already use to make better decisions.

[![Reverse ETL visualization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658076bf9430e82e20a78289_erccMZD9uPN16_rSj7pBbvgBjkKkyl1DXUJ7iDb0sIy46v9cyyZs5gSOYohWW99zP-j8WNy5re09cajuUtEbckmpkCnR031OvEgJddoD7a8k2x7FwQXXT5nEo7SUZVa5dzwaLrvw4anA_bPJNLgW7T0.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658076bf9430e82e20a78289_erccMZD9uPN16_rSj7pBbvgBjkKkyl1DXUJ7iDb0sIy46v9cyyZs5gSOYohWW99zP-j8WNy5re09cajuUtEbckmpkCnR031OvEgJddoD7a8k2x7FwQXXT5nEo7SUZVa5dzwaLrvw4anA_bPJNLgW7T0.webp)

Embedded reverse ETL lets your clients integrate their applications with your product via a [3rd-party integration tool,](https://www.merge.dev/blog/3rd-party-integration) and build a sync that keeps specific data between their applications and your product consistent with one another.

This can benefit your product—and, in turn, your clients—in a number of ways, from enriching your product’s analytics capabilities to enhancing its workflow automations.

Given all the forms that API and data integration can take, it can be difficult to determine how they differ—but we’ll attempt to do just that below.

## **Data integration vs API integration**

Data integration generally requires syncing data with a data warehouse, while API integration can involve syncing data with any type of system, so long as it offers the relevant API endpoint(s).

_Related:_ [_Comparing a unified API solution with an embedded iPaaS_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/embedded-ipaas-vs-unified-api)

## **Enable clients to integrate their apps with your product via Merge**

Offer a whole category of integrations—from HRIS to CRM to file storage—by connecting to [one of Merge's unified APIs](https://www.merge.dev/categories).

The leading product integration platform also offers robust maintenance support and management tooling to ensure you’re able to offer reliable and high performing integrations over time; [comprehensive Common Models](https://www.merge.dev/features/common-models) to help your clients access the data they want and need; [enterprise-grade security](https://www.merge.dev/security) to keep your clients' data safe—and much more.

You learn more about Merge and see the platform in action by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fapi-integration-vs-data-integration).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
