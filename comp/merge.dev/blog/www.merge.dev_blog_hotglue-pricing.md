Hotglue offers an embedded integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that lets SaaS companies add customer-facing integrations and workflow automations.

To help you assess the platform and determine whether it’s the right [application integration solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/application-integration-tools) for your business, we’ll break down how their pricing works.

## **Hotglue pricing overview**

Hotglue offers 3 pricing plans: Basic, Pro, and Enterprise.

[![Hotglue's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bc8514f00c7cd14e48_AD_4nXc3C7UKDP1HSmddL5WQFxP8sbn4Ez-i6CfkJut8HjWIx6nNr21n3E1E7_nalTyBcJf5KBPyd3ndQBY7FlNRxe60rHzUcmwWWrOfSGiL3wQ5rk6Kae1E05LpQobhhC0b0mG-gq0J2w.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bc8514f00c7cd14e48_AD_4nXc3C7UKDP1HSmddL5WQFxP8sbn4Ez-i6CfkJut8HjWIx6nNr21n3E1E7_nalTyBcJf5KBPyd3ndQBY7FlNRxe60rHzUcmwWWrOfSGiL3wQ5rk6Kae1E05LpQobhhC0b0mG-gq0J2w.png)

The Basic plan includes everything you need to get started and more. This includes access to all of their API connectors, the ability to [whitelabel embedded integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/white-label-api-integration), and even the ability to add a Python script that can transform raw data from 3rd-party systems before they're added to your product (“Python transformation layer”).

As you move up their plans, you’ll have access to better support and management features, such as an Enterprise SLA and observability tooling.

You’ll also be able to use more advanced features and get additional support around implementing integrations. For example, you can test integrations via the connector’s sandboxes on the Enterprise plan and you'd have access to on-prem connectors on both Pro and Enterprise plans.

## **Pros and cons of Hotglue’s pricing plans**

Here are some of the benefits of Hotglue’s pricing model:

- **Choose from several plans.** By offering 3 distinct plans, you can likely find one that closely matches what you’re looking for

- **Use any connector across plans.** No matter the connectors you need, you can leverage them across Hotglue’s pricing plans

- **Participate in a free trial.** While any mention of a free trial is buried in their pricing page, they can support one

[![Hotglue's mention of their free trial](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bc63ac059ca5aeb2ba_AD_4nXcSBPsHoFKtCmNjhKDq6cLTNv12HbQ2SrIWMXm_4TLtsRD-5E-m2esGVYoGOuhm2H6v0qcE1s_4iHwIHNl8qQMz7Nxm1b8uVuCU26lRYcYnxweFaWtwai04NKOhp3hghvh4EzDFzg.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bc63ac059ca5aeb2ba_AD_4nXcSBPsHoFKtCmNjhKDq6cLTNv12HbQ2SrIWMXm_4TLtsRD-5E-m2esGVYoGOuhm2H6v0qcE1s_4iHwIHNl8qQMz7Nxm1b8uVuCU26lRYcYnxweFaWtwai04NKOhp3hghvh4EzDFzg.png)

_Hotglue only mentions their free trial in the FAQ section of their pricing page_

Here are some of the drawbacks to consider:

- **No specifics on pricing.** You’re forced to speak with one of their sales reps to get any pricing figures. For example, there are no details on how much live integrations (or “Active Tenants”) would cost

[![Active Tenants pricing across plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bcfaacab849508f4a3_AD_4nXd4cOP4cbU8-5ke-uAGIYZ6A5gNU4R8nUAqjS2DZjtO4CR_dvvfkIkoC5O8TOkwFBZbuu5CJaxwwNuhY4N44OPszXVlkwGvcuTkt8ajHgKsxB3FS5wI-NHVCYAoXt2eRwfLRk-Rpw.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bcfaacab849508f4a3_AD_4nXd4cOP4cbU8-5ke-uAGIYZ6A5gNU4R8nUAqjS2DZjtO4CR_dvvfkIkoC5O8TOkwFBZbuu5CJaxwwNuhY4N44OPszXVlkwGvcuTkt8ajHgKsxB3FS5wI-NHVCYAoXt2eRwfLRk-Rpw.png)

_All Active Tenants, or integrations that have performed at least one sync over the past month, are labeled as “Custom” across plans_

- **Fail to mention support beyond their Enterprise SLA.** You can’t tell how much support is provided in a Basic or Pro plan, which can make it harder to pinpoint the plan that makes the most sense for your team

- **Force you to speak with a member of their team.** Your team can’t test the integrations yourselves or explore any of the platform's other features without speaking with a member of their team

- **Observability tooling isn’t part of the Basic plan.** The ability to [monitor integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-monitoring) via logs, automated detection functionality, and more is table stakes for diagnosing and addressing integration issues. But building and maintaining your own observability infrastructure likely isn’t sustainable. As a result, your team is forced to invest in either a Pro or Enterprise plan

## **How Merge address these issues**

Merge, the [leading unified API solution](https://www.merge.dev/blog/what-is-a-unified-api), provides a free plan (“Launch”) that lets your team pressure test Merge’s integrations without having to speak to a member of their team. Every plan also includes access to [Merge’s Integration Observability features](https://www.merge.dev/features/integration-observability).

[![Merge's pricing for Integration Observability features](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bdf776605ea1157f48_AD_4nXfSmqWXWudljM1ETwdQN8_qmMx6RKCo_pxYVUlwJzcKfOuASzsy8JIuT2vjJJwpsOr0SCdtlvEzN5FHqnn7zXQ9l_tvNftJ8mIGBBqHkMK7Smtk3BTxSgocNtQJx1a3QMUonxCSdA.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/683625bdf776605ea1157f48_AD_4nXfSmqWXWudljM1ETwdQN8_qmMx6RKCo_pxYVUlwJzcKfOuASzsy8JIuT2vjJJwpsOr0SCdtlvEzN5FHqnn7zXQ9l_tvNftJ8mIGBBqHkMK7Smtk3BTxSgocNtQJx1a3QMUonxCSdA.png)

_Regardless of the plan you’re on, Merge provides access to powerful Integration Observability capabilities_

Merge also offers more clarity on the level of support provided across plans. For instance, its Professional plan lets you access a shared Slack channel with members of Merge’s post-sales team for the first 90 days, and the enterprise plan includes onboarding calls with your customers to ensure they’re set up on Merge's integrations successfully and quickly.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
