Grok consists of a family of large language models (LLMs) developed by xAI.

While the models are helpful within X (formerly Twitter), they can offer even more value when they’re integrated with your product or your internal applications.

For either integration scenario, you’ll need to start by creating your API key on xAI. We’ll help you do just that in 5 simple steps!

### **1\. Click on the API tab**

From [the xAI homepage](https://x.ai/), click on the “API” tab.

[![xAI homepage](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe902cdd649352c11b73_AD_4nXeGzNqTPDpc4bi39eMmPpytUOUox6Oq8SJXA1fi-HCyTckCaQG0cYcqGuougWpGIRjhG8ua9X87ZxeHIDOvKHNZYm_lgvuWjoasRp2VYwTBq8rF-ggNmvnVDWW7Fm6v3Aky6XaHog.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe902cdd649352c11b73_AD_4nXeGzNqTPDpc4bi39eMmPpytUOUox6Oq8SJXA1fi-HCyTckCaQG0cYcqGuougWpGIRjhG8ua9X87ZxeHIDOvKHNZYm_lgvuWjoasRp2VYwTBq8rF-ggNmvnVDWW7Fm6v3Aky6XaHog.webp)

#### Looking to integrate beyond Grok?

Merge lets you build to a single API to offer hundreds of integrations for your product.

### **2\. Select “Start building now”**

Above the fold, you should see a button that says, “Start building now.” Once you select that, you’ll be directed to xAI’s sign in page.

### **3\. Create or log into your xAI account to access your API console**

You can sign in in one of three ways: enter your email address and password manually or go through an OAuth flow to authenticate either via your Twitter or Google account.

[![Sign in screen to xAI](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe90cf8aaffcbed9802e_AD_4nXcU7L2EKecZEwaWuWtCKC8Z6E_2YyM1VrLI0u7rafuWNT7-aOG_aTPHw8XBENVzWHPASOoyAAvytL6CXff1SB-BmP1ImvfhR-vREWTKxEhOyt4-5bj7AIJOrIXhmKt2xcocsPN_eQ.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe90cf8aaffcbed9802e_AD_4nXcU7L2EKecZEwaWuWtCKC8Z6E_2YyM1VrLI0u7rafuWNT7-aOG_aTPHw8XBENVzWHPASOoyAAvytL6CXff1SB-BmP1ImvfhR-vREWTKxEhOyt4-5bj7AIJOrIXhmKt2xcocsPN_eQ.webp)

### **4\. Select “Manage API keys”**

Below the welcome message, you should see a small text block that reads, “Manage API keys.” Click on this.

[![Manage API keys button](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe9003c073e09d68ee15_AD_4nXdk8SuQA7VW2e3Jep9ObgLtJDl3U5kYe2Q3HPy-yhLW4LW--HIDrZHAP8XL7mRa_FChyCBSMYcO2iUs4XhCAee1e7ViXShxp0-ryoOaAUVbPN7A2bOYlFTkrfUqFxSGjCeDxuHXBQ.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe9003c073e09d68ee15_AD_4nXdk8SuQA7VW2e3Jep9ObgLtJDl3U5kYe2Q3HPy-yhLW4LW--HIDrZHAP8XL7mRa_FChyCBSMYcO2iUs4XhCAee1e7ViXShxp0-ryoOaAUVbPN7A2bOYlFTkrfUqFxSGjCeDxuHXBQ.webp)

### **5\. Create your API key**

Once you select “Create API key,” you should see a pop-up that prompts you to name the key, select the endpoints you want to grant it, and pick the models it can use. Finally, you’ll be able to preview and generate the key.

Once you’ve created it, you'll be able to view its usage and edit, disable, or delete it. You can also create an entirely new key by clicking on Create API key.

### ‍ **Other considerations for building to Grok’s API**

Before building to Grok’s API, it’s worth familiarizing yourself with the following:

#### **Pricing**

Grok’s pricing varies depending on the type of output you’re hoping to generate and the specific model you want to use.

For instance, Grok 2’s price per million text tokens is $2 while Grok Beta's is $5.

[![Pricing across Grok's models](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe910a5d63863843d72a_AD_4nXdoWWM7EDEEAo8u8WUqtBTcU1NT3rGO_gjmKiNk7aiBw0gG6YlkQ24q-LvG1JbnejvBUr-GjCCmCewH4tvlDdqOqO7l7Aiq3oxCbOiG11BsA-iIYlQD0meqB8Up5IsydBn6e7x5NA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe910a5d63863843d72a_AD_4nXdoWWM7EDEEAo8u8WUqtBTcU1NT3rGO_gjmKiNk7aiBw0gG6YlkQ24q-LvG1JbnejvBUr-GjCCmCewH4tvlDdqOqO7l7Aiq3oxCbOiG11BsA-iIYlQD0meqB8Up5IsydBn6e7x5NA.webp)

_Learn more about_ [_Grok’s pricing_](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models) _._

#### **Rate limits**

Every user is currently limited to 1 request per second and either 60 or 1,200 requests per hour (depending on the model).

[![Grok's rate limits across models](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe917bf57c15d3e8dddb_AD_4nXejWqQ7AVBKx79FiYbqL8PZoHBk7SA7HPwCyBppdqdt3dRNLedGMvfuIiOx-sAJRgfQvo2PEntmlgcT0xz5OkFJhKnRkIJ5JkGIyarpl9E7nTggQVeSWjeKZjQPG2xY0AYtGmV-ZA.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6776fe917bf57c15d3e8dddb_AD_4nXejWqQ7AVBKx79FiYbqL8PZoHBk7SA7HPwCyBppdqdt3dRNLedGMvfuIiOx-sAJRgfQvo2PEntmlgcT0xz5OkFJhKnRkIJ5JkGIyarpl9E7nTggQVeSWjeKZjQPG2xY0AYtGmV-ZA.webp)

#### **Errors to look out for**

You can get all kinds of errors. This includes the following:

- **403 Forbidden:** you don't have the necessary permissions to make the request
- **404 Not Found:** the requested resource either doesn’t exist or you made an error within your request (e.g., your request is missing a key parameter)
- **429 Too Many Requests:** you’ve exceeded your predefined rate limit in the current window
- **500 Internal Server Error:** this (along with other 5xx error codes) means there’s an issue with xAI’s backend servers

Discover additional API error codes and how you can go about addressing them in [this blog post](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-response-codes).

### **Final thoughts**

Your product integration requirements likely extend far beyond Grok.

If you need to integrate your product with hundreds of 3rd-party applications that fall under popular software categories, like CRM, HRIS, file storage, or accounting, you can simply connect to Merge’s Unified API.

Merge also provides comprehensive integration maintenance support and management tooling for your customer-facing teams—all but ensuring that your integrations perform at a high level over time.

You can learn more about Merge by [scheduling a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fllama-api-key).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
