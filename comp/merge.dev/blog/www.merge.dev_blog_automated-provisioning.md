Auto-provisioning has seemingly gotten more popular over the last few years.

The reasons aren’t hard to discern; it allows B2B SaaS companies to increase product usage and security for their customers, and it gives IT/security teams a way to reduce onboarding time and remove unused application seats automatically.

To help your organization use auto-provisioning effectively, we’ll walk through what it is, its benefits, examples of using it, and some best practices for implementing it in your product. We'll also introduce you to some auto-provisioning platforms for both internal and product/customer-facing use-cases.

## **What is automated provisioning?**

It’s the automated assignment of employee permissions, such as software seats or billing controls, based on the employee’s department, team, among other factors. Auto-provisioning also includes auto-deprovisioning, which means revoking access if those parameters change in a certain, predefined way.

## **Benefits of automated provisioning**

Here are some of the top benefits to keep in mind:

### **Provides time savings**

According to a study by Vendr in 2023, [the average SaaS company uses 130+ SaaS solutions.](https://www.vendr.com/blog/saas-statistics) Attempting to keep every application up to date with new hires and leavers can therefore be an impossible job. Adding fuel to the fire, creating a new user oftentimes requires filling out a variety of fields, like first name, last name, email address, role, and org chart information, which makes this type of data entry work all the more overwhelming to perform over time.

Automated provisioning based on whether someone has joined a company or departed can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to manually fill out information for each user.

This can also benefit SaaS vendors; decreasing the amount of time it takes to onboard new users to their product can be a quick way to improve product adoption and stickiness.

### **Improves security**

Although deprovisioning is often a critical step in employee offboarding processes, it’s easy to miss departed users in a few applications when security and IT has so many applications to remove them from. This can result in every security team’s nightmare: seeing departed employees still have access to critical company information.

Automated removal of recent departures can provide a sense of relief for security teams who may be worried about scaling security and application access as a company grows.

### **Increases product usage**

One reason why a lot of companies may end up suffering from churn is that their clients fail to fully adopt and use their product. Even if one person is extremely passionate about a product, it’s hard justify the investment; you need several individuals, if not entire teams, to become active users.

Automatically issuing access to every employee is an easy way to remove the barriers for entry for new users. This can be especially true for new hires. Reason being, when employees first joining a company, they’ll get used to the first few vendors they're introduced to and incorporate them into their workflows.

### **Reduces human errors**

Keying in data manually is an extremely error-prone activity. In some cases, it can lead to seemingly innocuous errors, like misspelling someone’s name. But in other cases, these errors have consequential downstream effects.

For instance, if an employee’s email address is misspelled, they may not receive an invite for an event; or, if an employee’s role is incorrect, they may get additional permissions in an application and access information that isn’t meant for them.

There are so many ways in which human error can cause major issues, and preventing this through auto-provisioning can be a huge relief for security teams.

## **Examples of automated provisioning**

Here are some examples of auto-provisioning:

### Grant new hires access to an application on their first day

Here is a recommended flow that we've seen for auto-provisioning applications on behalf of new hires:

1\. Build [integrations with HRIS](https://www.merge.dev/blog/guide-to-hris-api-integrations) / SCIM providers.

2\. Build a user interface that supports your customer auto-provisioning new users based on information in the HRIS / SCIM provider.

3\. Once an HRIS / SCIM has added a new employee, create a new user for that employee in your application.

4\. Send the new hire an email informing them of their new account in the application.

5\. Allow them to onboard with their information and org chart information filled out based on information from the HRIS.

6\. Send an email to IT / security informing them of the new user account.

### Change a user’s permissions when they switch teams

When an employee moves to a new team and works under a new manager, the amount of access  they are privy to may change. Through managing user permissions based on org chart information, IT / security teams can offload some of the responsibilities of changing permissions to an application.

Here is a recommended flow we've seen:

1\. Build integrations with HRIS / SCIM providers.

2\. Build a user interface that supports your customer auto-provisioning permissions based on org chart information in the HRIS / SCIM provider.

3\. Once an HRIS / SCIM has notified you of a change in the org chart, modify the corresponding user’s permissions in your application according to the permissions that your customer has set for this user’s new role.

4\. Send an email to IT / security informing them of the permission change.

## **Best practices for auto-provisioning**

Auto-provisioning and deprovisioning is one of Merge’s most popular use cases, and we’ve learned a lot about best practices through seeing our customers implement it in their products.

Here are some recommendations for adding auto-provisioning to your products:

### Integrate with a variety of HRIS / SCIM providers

The HRIS / SCIM landscape is extremely fragmented. If you only integrate with 1-2 HRIS / SCIM providers, it’s unlikely that you’ll cover most of your customers.

[![A visual of HRIS vendors](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654bd009ccf8603a477b85af_xLfXMGUSCYA_gVdkNzWIRIYAp9DftFKgeXRMVyuHJSwaayILC4A02V-kmNNNslOxLU5790TdJgCYj-3yrerDhDIaLivJwhrXoQNqNpuyIhvSZ1c0YbmT304He_5aP7MoncUyFcMmjDcCpBR5oI8JSI4.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/654bd009ccf8603a477b85af_xLfXMGUSCYA_gVdkNzWIRIYAp9DftFKgeXRMVyuHJSwaayILC4A02V-kmNNNslOxLU5790TdJgCYj-3yrerDhDIaLivJwhrXoQNqNpuyIhvSZ1c0YbmT304He_5aP7MoncUyFcMmjDcCpBR5oI8JSI4.webp)

_The_ [_G2 chart for HRIS_](https://www.g2.com/categories/core-hr#grid) _is extremely crowded_

### Build an intuitive UI that allows your customers to customize their auto-provisioning

Each company will likely have varied processes and security requirements for their team members. Generally, the larger the company, the more stringent the security requirements are.  IT / security team members at these companies will likely want to customize the access levels that are granted on a more granular level.

Building a UI that your customers can modify according to their own processes ensures that they're able to continue auto-provisioning/deprovisioning users in your product over time.

### Build a proactive alerting system that informs IT / security teams of user permission changes as they occur

Automating user changes based on an HRIS / SCIM integration can be slightly nerve-wracking, as there's a small chance that an accidental setting causes issues. To ensure that your IT / security team becomes aware of any errors and addresses them quickly, you can send them notifications whenever there are permission changes.
