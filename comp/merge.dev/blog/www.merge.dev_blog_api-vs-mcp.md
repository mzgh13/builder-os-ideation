The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has seemingly become the de facto method for integrating large language models (LLMs) with 3rd-party data sources.

This has led to speculation on the future of APIs and whether they’ll be relevant in a world where AI companies rely on MCP to access data.

In truth, the rise of MCP should only elevate the role APIs play in [supporting AI products](https://www.merge.dev/blog/ai-product-strategy).

We’ll break down why by highlighting how they work and complement one another.

## **What is MCP?**

[The Model Context Protocol](https://www.merge.dev/blog/model-context-protocol) is a newly-developed standard from Anthropic that outlines how AI companies can interact with outside data sources, such as SaaS applications, files, and databases.

[![How MCP works](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f45a48f67797c0c02c97c7_AD_4nXe3Kn7LtWbsK5kB0znKMVUhHj9MufS3tWJm_YJ51cj3wFgUDwEU2LoqQh07lI4NkefizpohfUyQSyv3tGd1xr8YnGB5TJJ6jSP6OLkYmLibzoviTjJE4_IPWMirr-aBjs2AbOWS.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f45a48f67797c0c02c97c7_AD_4nXe3Kn7LtWbsK5kB0znKMVUhHj9MufS3tWJm_YJ51cj3wFgUDwEU2LoqQh07lI4NkefizpohfUyQSyv3tGd1xr8YnGB5TJJ6jSP6OLkYmLibzoviTjJE4_IPWMirr-aBjs2AbOWS.png)

In basic terms, MCP includes 3 components:

- An MCP client, which the LLM interfaces with directly

- An MCP server, which the data provider offers to expose data and functionality

- Tools, which appear within the MCP client and allow the LLM to take specific actions

It’s also worth noting that the LLM decides on the tool it uses based on the user’s input and the tools it has at its disposal.

For example, say your customer asks your [AI chatbot](https://www.merge.dev/blog/how-to-build-ai-chatbot) to create a specific ticket on their behalf.

Your LLM would then select a tool specific to creating tickets in that customer’s project management system.

[![An MCP use case for creating tickets](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f45a480de6adfb9eceb575_AD_4nXdB4t7UOgBbGcMcp9-ArioVLUdq24rbwgZu49HYXy8UtPSodVBVnx32mYTvt9lHsd-M_50X5tARNMy_Mk8JdLHjORNFjh4zkL69_OZVNwiDVv4ub7E-3r5JUQYqp-sTgksZQq3m.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f45a480de6adfb9eceb575_AD_4nXdB4t7UOgBbGcMcp9-ArioVLUdq24rbwgZu49HYXy8UtPSodVBVnx32mYTvt9lHsd-M_50X5tARNMy_Mk8JdLHjORNFjh4zkL69_OZVNwiDVv4ub7E-3r5JUQYqp-sTgksZQq3m.png)

## **What is an API?**

An API encompasses a set of protocols and rules that lay out how applications can communicate with one another securely.

[![Visualization of how API requests work](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f6a1643aa993cf39eb5a87_API%20overview%20(2).png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f6a1643aa993cf39eb5a87_API%20overview%20(2).png)

_API requests can also get triggered by user actions or on demand_

On a more granular level, APIs are made up of endpoints that let you access specific data and functionality from a 3rd-party system. For instance, this endpoint from BambooHR lets you retrieve employees from the HR software: `https://api.bamboohr.com/api/gateway.php/{companyDomain}/v1/employees`

With all this context in mind, let’s now break down how MCP compares with APIs.

_There’s obviously a lot more to APIs. You can learn more about API rate limits, API logs, how APIs differ from webhooks, and more below._

- [_A guide to REST API authentication_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/rest-api-authentication)
- [_How to manage REST API rate limits_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/rest-api-rate-limits)
- [_What you need to know about API logs_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-logs)
- [_REST APIs vs webhooks_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/rest-api-vs-webhooks)

## **MCP vs API**

APIs can be a part of tools that are available via an MCP server. For example, when an LLM decides on the tool to use, that tool can include making a certain API request and then providing the response to the LLM.

Without APIs, you’d be left with tools that use scrapers—or custom scripts—and this alternative approach would come with several issues:

- **Error prone:** Simple UI changes can cause these integrations to break; scrapers can also easily fail or get blocked. _APIs don’t share these vulnerabilities (though they do require some level of maintenance, depending on the build)_

- **Infrequent syncs:** Scapers can get delayed, as they often depend on brittle workflows, limited scheduling options, and unpredictable third-party site/application behavior. _APIs, on the other hand, can reliably sync data extremely frequently, such as every second_

- ‍ **Security vulnerabilities:** Scraping may expose sensitive data because it doesn’t use HTTPS encryption, has weak authentication, or mismanages tokens. _APIs typically enforce secure transport (HTTPS) and use standardized auth flows (e.g., OAuth 2.0)_

In short: Since LLMs need to access near real-time data reliably and securely from 3rd-party systems, APIs offer the best approach to supporting MCP.

## **Connect your LLM to all of your customers' apps via Merge MCP**

Merge MCP lets you access all of our integrations and endpoints through the Model Context Protocol.

[![A visualization of Merge MCP](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f68b6115b3b49fb5f41c86_Frame%202087327327.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/67f68b6115b3b49fb5f41c86_Frame%202087327327.png)

You’ll still get access to the rest of our features and capabilities, from our Integration Observability tools that let your customer-facing teams manage integrations to our security features that let you follow the principle of data minimization—such as Common Model Scopes.

To learn more about Merge MCP—which is available to every customer for free—you can [schedule a demo with one of our integration experts](https://www.merge.dev/get-in-touch?utm_btn=dr-page-blog%2Fapi-vs-mcp) or connect with your dedicated CSM.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
