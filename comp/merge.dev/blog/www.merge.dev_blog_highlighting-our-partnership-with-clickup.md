The ClickUp team recently spun up a [card highlighting](https://clickup.com/integrations) the integration our team at Merge team built! In honor of the launch, we wanted to feature what’s possible with Merge’s ClickUp integration through our Unified Ticketing API.

## What is ClickUp?

[ClickUp](http://www.clickup.com/) delivers an all-in-one workplace productivity platform that flexes to the way people want to work.

From Custom Views to automations, Task Relationships, and limitless dashboards, ClickUp helps users prioritize projects, collaborate with teams, stay connected to goals, store knowledge and track success from anywhere.

## How does Merge’s integration with ClickUp work?

At its most basic, our ClickUp integration lets you access data such as:

- Folders
- Workspaces
- Tasks
- Comments

Directly from your user’s ClickUp account!

Merge’s secret is in _unifying_ the data we pull from ClickUp. Those above ClickUp endpoints are normalized into data models that are built to reflect project management data across _all platforms_. We refer to these as Common Models.

For example, we pull information from ClickUp’s “Tasks” endpoint and turn it into the “Tickets” model in our API. The key is that “Tickets” doesn’t just act as a reference for data from ClickUp - for any platform we offer as part of our Unified Ticketing API, you can reliably call the “Tickets” endpoint to return data.

Explore our docs to see which endpoints we offer, and what platforms we normalize data on behalf of.

When you interact with Merge, you just need to pull the above Common Models to access data from ClickUp. Or Asana. Or Front. Or Intercom. Or... you get the idea.

### **How does authentication work?**

With Merge, you don’t need to worry about handling any tricky authentication issues across integrations.

When your end-user authenticates their ClickUp, we process their credentials through a secure token exchange that ensures their data is secure and syncs reliably with your app.

Even better, if any auth issues surface because of expired API keys on your user's side, we offer robust [**log search**](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product/introducing-api-log-search-/) and issues detection that allows any member of your team - not just engineering - to investigate and guide your user through fixing the errors.

### **Am I able to access ClickUp’s API directly?**

Answer: we certainly won’t stop you.

Our [**supplemental data**](https://www.merge.dev/docs/supplemental-data/) allows you to access original data from ClickUp in two ways. First, you can use [**remote data**](https://www.merge.dev/docs/supplemental-data/remote-data/), which gives you access to all the data that was sent in the response from ClickUp to Merge. If that doesn’t cut it, then you can access the ClickUp API directly via [**supplemental data**](https://www.merge.dev/docs/supplemental-data/passthrough/). And with supplemental data, Merge still handles authentication, no matter the API.

### **Where do I sign up?**

If you’re interested in testing out our ClickUp integration, you can start by signing up for a free ClickUp account [on their site](https://clickup.com/). You can then create a [test linked account](https://www.merge.dev/docs/get-started/linked-account/) with your ClickUp API key.

With that info, it’s just a matter of inputting your ClickUp credentials in our Public Postman repo and, boom! You’re now pulling Merge’s normalized data!

If you have questions, feel free to reach out over Intercom or check out our [Help Center](https://help.merge.dev/en/).

And curious if our Project Management API fits your use case?

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
