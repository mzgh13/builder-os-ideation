# How Merge helps Deel grow and manage their rapidly-expanding partner ecosystem

Deel, the all-in-one HR and payroll platform for global teams, needed to accelerate its integration capabilities to better support a period of hyper customer growth and additions to its product offerings.

Deel’s integrations team set out to build integrations with many of these HR applications, which include payroll, benefits, and performance management solutions. However, Deel’s meteoric growth led to a seemingly never-ending list of integration requests with tools that are popular in specific regions, industries, and for particular company sizes.

Thomas Dale, Deel’s Director of Product Partnerships, explains why this situation soon became problematic: “Scaling our engineering team just so that it kept pace with integration requests didn’t make sense for us financially. The best way we could serve our customers’ needs quickly and grow in a fiscally conscious way was to work with an integration partner.”

After evaluating potential partners, they soon landed on Merge.

“It quickly became apparent that Merge was deeply invested in partnering with us. This made us confident that if we uncovered new integration opportunities over time, their team would have our back and support us effectively,” explains Thomas.

### **Allowing dozens of software solutions to integrate with Deel through Merge**

After a few weeks of collaboration between Deel’s engineers and Merge’s Partner Engineers, Merge was able to add Deel to Merge’s HRIS Unified API.

This allows Merge’s customers and Deel’s partners to easily integrate with Deel’s API and 60+ other applications in [Merge’s HRIS Unified API.](https://www.merge.dev/categories/hr-payroll-api)

For example, Confirm, an all-in-one people platform, is a customer of ours and a Deel partner—so they can easily add Deel to their list of integrations via Merge.

Moreover, using [Merge Link](https://docs.merge.dev/get-started/link/), Confirm can make it easy for users to access their integration with Deel.

Here’s how the process of setting up the integration would work for Confirm’s users:

1\. A user would visit Confirm’s integrations page and click on “Select HRIS or ATS integration."

[![Confirm's integrations page](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6632569023a633a268a332bf_Kn2CRsXnCQDcRJ48F1dhvzIPCXM99bFG5ZV0wYLIvvQ4AbfPaDSL-GrU3FWMZSHkasNkxB-jFCKDXFC72ZqeCBwLlokrvxN1D0yirdKoghliRrtaKS9nkQ5A54NVHquBI7ArF82b914PhLK6BQxGMFk.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6632569023a633a268a332bf_Kn2CRsXnCQDcRJ48F1dhvzIPCXM99bFG5ZV0wYLIvvQ4AbfPaDSL-GrU3FWMZSHkasNkxB-jFCKDXFC72ZqeCBwLlokrvxN1D0yirdKoghliRrtaKS9nkQ5A54NVHquBI7ArF82b914PhLK6BQxGMFk.webp)

2\. Merge Link would pop up.

[![Merge Link pop up](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66325690e31511bc497da1a2__b9RgAHV42hGsOJFi-3DxVjV4QtwltM0nn__F2twRUfj4ddwsqKURAaEKZDWswkQ1_GH03xlpObNqwUb5wkjcSlNhofM-GJOSgRdtQ2-thakHADUnwfbS97ocWL-TfO4ytNyChbr6KEkMHY5pIuobg4.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/66325690e31511bc497da1a2__b9RgAHV42hGsOJFi-3DxVjV4QtwltM0nn__F2twRUfj4ddwsqKURAaEKZDWswkQ1_GH03xlpObNqwUb5wkjcSlNhofM-GJOSgRdtQ2-thakHADUnwfbS97ocWL-TfO4ytNyChbr6KEkMHY5pIuobg4.webp)

3\. From there, the user can browse through the list of applications (all of which are powered by Merge) and find Deel.

4\. Once they select Deel, they can authenticate to the platform.

5\. The user would then configure the integration.

6\. Finally, the user can complete the authorization flow.

### **Growing their partner program exponentially**

By integrating through Merge, Merge’s customers can become eligible for the Deel Partner Program, which enables them to work more closely with Deel on go-to-market motions and revenue sharing opportunities.

This has led to some exciting partnerships: “A lot of the most innovative and exciting B2B tech companies use Merge,” Thomas explains. “This has enabled us to add them to our partner program more easily and co-market and co-sell in new and fast-growing markets.”

In addition, as Deel’s customers add integrations through Merge, Deel’s engineering team doesn’t need to get involved when the integrations break or need to improve; the team at Merge takes this work off their plate altogether.

Thomas elaborates: **“** Merge’s support is consistently best-in-class. We know that no matter what issues take place, their team will pinpoint the issues on time and work to resolve them as quickly as possible. This not only saves our developers and customer success teams time but it also gives them peace of mind.”

Finally, beyond the business benefits of helping their customers access more HR integrations, Merge’s commitment to Deel has stood out.

“The team at Merge has doubled down on our relationship over time and has proven that they’ll do whatever it takes for us to be successful, whether that’s adding a new integration, improving an existing feature, or training our teams in-person,” Thomas notes.

We look forward to strengthening our partnership even further in the years to come.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
