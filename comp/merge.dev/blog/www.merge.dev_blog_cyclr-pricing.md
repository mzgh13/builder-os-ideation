Cyclr is a UK-based embedded iPaaS solution that lets you build hundreds of customer-facing integrations and automations through their “low-code, drag-and-drop integration workflow builder.”

To help you evaluate the platform and determine whether it’s the right integration solution for your business, we’ll break down their pricing strategy.

## **Overview on Cyclr’s pricing model**

Cyclr has 4 plans: Pay As You Go (PAYG), Growth, Scale, and Enterprise.

[![Cyclr's pricing plans](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b6b81326523858446f9ea_AD_4nXd_cbpNNKao1uNtOoGdHn4eUaBu8lqzhug0XEYgV5dNTYlzIFa70DCVb_K0UHY7iTlkcpteP26yRM-1RQ7MAhO_AV04fONsp3VdaGWJvP5y_ivf2EY-IrVKdBHCoPb2mN1lJWBQMQ.png)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/682b6b81326523858446f9ea_AD_4nXd_cbpNNKao1uNtOoGdHn4eUaBu8lqzhug0XEYgV5dNTYlzIFa70DCVb_K0UHY7iTlkcpteP26yRM-1RQ7MAhO_AV04fONsp3VdaGWJvP5y_ivf2EY-IrVKdBHCoPb2mN1lJWBQMQ.png)

As you move up these plans, you can offer more performant and [secure integrations at scale](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-security).

Here are some examples:

- They offer a package of 10 [application connectors](https://www.merge.dev/blog/api-connector), or pre-built integrations, when you move from PAYG to Growth

- The volume of API calls you're allotted scales dramatically between plans. From Growth to Scale, as an example, the allotted call volume increases from 1 to 5 million

- The number of concurrent processes you can run increases exponentially, from 25 in PAYG to 50 in Growth to 100 in Scale.

Their enterprise plan also offers more flexibility, white glove support, and advanced security features

For instance, you can embed their workflow builder in your app so that customers can build integrations and automations themselves. And you can have full control over where and how integrations are hosted to maintain compliance with data privacy regulations, meet customer expectations, and align with your infrastructure needs.

## **Pros and cons of Cyclr’s pricing strategy**

Here are some of the strengths of their pricing model:

- **Offers a free 2-week trial.** This lets you test a few integrations, explore their [embedded marketplace](https://www.merge.dev/blog/integration-marketplace) offering, see how robust their integration management capabilities are, and more

- **Provides short-term flexibility.** Even once you move forward with their solution post trial, you can sign up for a monthly subscription and cancel at any time

- **Has enterprise-grade security features available across plans.** Every plan includes compliance with critical data privacy and protection regulations (like GDPR and SOC2 Level II) and provides access controls to help keep customer data secure

It’s also worth considering these drawbacks:

- **Lacks dedicated support resources.** PAYG and Growth plans don’t have a dedicated account manager on hand to help make sure you get the most of your subscription, such as training your customer-facing teams on selling, supporting, and marketing the integrations you take to market

- **Limits integration scalability.** The Growth, and Scale plans limit you to 10 connectors, while the PAYG plan doesn’t come with any connectors (each would come with a monthly add-on fee)

Since you’ll likely need to offer significantly more than 10 product integrations, you’ll end up relying on their “Connector Creation Toolkit" over time. And while this might be faster and less complex than [building each integration from scratch](https://www.merge.dev/blog/native-integrations), it still puts a lot of the technical burden on your developers.

- **Forces customers to rely on your team.** Unless you’re on the enterprise plan, customers can't build and manage integrations themselves within your platform

This can introduce friction in your customer relationships (as many may want this option) and it can also make it harder on your team to scale integration adoption—as your team will need to accommodate increasing integration requests quickly and effectively.

## **How Merge addresses these drawbacks**

Using Merge, you don’t have to continually purchase and leverage pre-built connectors or their Connector Creation Toolkit to build integrations.

Simply build to Merge’s Unified API once to add hundreds of integrations to your product.

Merge also offers strategic post-sales resources across our core plans to help you take your integrations to market successfully—whether that’s deciding how to [price your integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/pricing-software-integrations), enabling sellers to talk about them with prospects, helping marketing launch the most impactful promotional activities, and more.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
