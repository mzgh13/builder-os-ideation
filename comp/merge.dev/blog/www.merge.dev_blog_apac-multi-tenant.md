We’re fully committed to providing features and capabilities that let us meet and exceed all of our customers’ and end-users’ security needs—no matter where our customers and end-users are based.

This mission has led us to offer product features like [Scopes](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/5950052-common-model-and-field-scopes) and [Audit Trail](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/8813877-merge-audit-trail-enhancing-security-compliance), and it’s pushed us to invest in broader security measures and infrastructure, such as adopting rigorous encryption policies and providing single and multi-tenant environments in Europe.

We’re excited to announce that we’ve taken another step in this mission by offering a multi-tenant option in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region.

You can read on to learn what this means, how you can adopt it, and more.

### **Overview on our APAC multi-tenant**

Our multi-tenant allows customers to store data in AWS data centers within Singapore.

These data centers offer enterprise-grade physical and network security, ensuring that data stays protected from malicious actors. Moreover, they allow our customers and end-users in the region to meet their data residency requirements, which allows them to avoid costly penalties and reputational damage. And, last but not least, they enable our customers to close more sales in the region, as our customers can now more easily provide APAC-compliant integrations.

### **How to use our APAC multi-tenant**

The multi-tenant is available to customers regardless of the plan they’re on. Customers can also choose which end-users' data gets stored in this data center and which gets stored in our U.S. or Europe-based centers. This gives customers and their end-users complete control over where their data is stored.

To access the multi-tenant, you can simply create an account [here](https://app-ap.merge.dev/signup), or, when creating an account on our default sign-up page, select the USA dropdown and click on APAC.

If you need any help with using it, you can simply notify your dedicated customer success manager or email us at support@merge.dev.

### **Final thoughts**

While we’re excited about this launch, we plan to release additional tenants in APAC and across other regions. We’ll also continue to provide the most reliable and secure product integration solution in every region by making additional security investments in our platform and in our infrastructure.

You can learn more about the APAC multi-tenant on [our Help Center](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/9504987-apac-multi-tenant-frequently-asked-questions-faq). And you can dive into the rest of our security policies, infrastructure, features, and more [here](https://www.merge.dev/security).

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
