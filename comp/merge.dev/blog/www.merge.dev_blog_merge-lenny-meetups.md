@Merge

Lenny Rachitsky has helped countless PMs hone key skills, rethink their product workflows, advance in their careers, and more through his newsletter and podcast.

Given Lenny’s track record of providing unparalleled content to the PM community, we knew his latest initiative—hosting global meetups—would be hugely successful.

Since we share Lenny’s mission of helping product managers thrive, we’ve decided to sponsor his upcoming meetups!

Here’s more on what you can expect from his meetups over the coming months.

## **Overview on Lenny’s meetups**

The meetups are meant to help a small group of local product professionals network, chat through what’s working and what isn’t, and form personal connections—all while enjoying a few free drinks (courtesy of yours truly).

And while these meetups are primarily geared towards PMs, professionals in other disciplines—like growth marketing—are also encouraged to attend. This helps foster cross-functional learning and allows PMs to better understand how they can support and influence other parts of the business.

To join one of Lenny’s meetups, you’d need to [become a paid subscriber to Lenny’s Newsletter](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lennysnewsletter.com%2Fp%2Fcommunity). From there, you can join the Friends of Lenny’s Newsletter Slack Community, join the Slack channel for your city, and RSVP to the events announced there.

## **Event Schedule**

The meetups will take place throughout the Spring, Summer, and Fall across North America, Europe, and the Middle East.

You can see all of the current events—as well as any that get updated over time— [here](https://merge-landing-page.webflow.io/lennys-meetup#schedule).

## **Our partnership with Lenny is only getting started**

Merge has a track record of enabling Lenny to execute best-in-class content for PMs, from being the headline sponsor of his inaugural summit to advertising in several of his podcast episodes.

Sponsoring these meetups is just another milestone in our partnership, and we have plenty more planned over the coming months.

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
