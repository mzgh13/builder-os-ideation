When deciding whether to integrate specific applications, you’ll likely need to perform extensive cost-benefit analysis.

To help you determine the potential benefits of any integration, we’ll break down the top ones to consider.

But first, let’s align on the definition of application integration.

## **What is application integration?**

It’s the process of connecting applications, typically through their APIs. Once connected, you can sync specific types of data between the systems in near real-time or on a predefined, time-based cadence.

In addition, you can build application integrations internally, meaning, between the applications your teams use, or between your product and clients’ applications (i.e. [product integrations](https://www.merge.dev/blog/product-integrations)).

[![The two types of application itnegration](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65822abc407c71baaea9b633_BSHEHEuBjT8GqvG1EPYlQaFJPN9SY_nrEaBPAuIBz78tpqL9Lf3FZ1f3B-45Xd2ktb6GdJvHuwFpnJhZVkXH1egARFeONJbv7lde09nDLdQmhyc7MBr8SOa7sMtQgFLaVXEB85YTAcAqPf-GO4Iaa-M.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65822abc407c71baaea9b633_BSHEHEuBjT8GqvG1EPYlQaFJPN9SY_nrEaBPAuIBz78tpqL9Lf3FZ1f3B-45Xd2ktb6GdJvHuwFpnJhZVkXH1egARFeONJbv7lde09nDLdQmhyc7MBr8SOa7sMtQgFLaVXEB85YTAcAqPf-GO4Iaa-M.webp)

## ‍ **Application integration benefits**

We’ll first look at the top benefits of internal applications integrations (our first four benefits) and then review the top benefits of product integrations (the following three benefits).

[![Benefits of application integration for internal use cases](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658242845795988d28540baa_Application%20integration%20benefits%20for%20internal%20use%20cases%20(3).webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/658242845795988d28540baa_Application%20integration%20benefits%20for%20internal%20use%20cases%20(3).webp)

### **Improves employee collaboration**

By allowing employees to access the same set of data within the systems they’re already using, they’re more likely to work together effectively and arrive at decisions quickly. For instance, if marketing and sales can access the same set of data on leads, they can easily agree on when one party should reach out to a given lead and what their messaging should be.

### **Enhances productivity**

When employees can avoid having to hop between systems to find information and/or re-enter data, they’re able to save precious time—which they can reallocate toward more impactful tasks.

### **Eliminates data silos**

Since employees can access the data they need within the systems they’re already using, they don’t need to request access to other applications, ask colleagues for the information, or operate without knowing it exists. In other words, application integrations neatly break down and prevent data silos.

_Related:_ [_Application integration best practices_](https://www.merge.dev/blog/application-integration-best-practices)

### **Streamlines processes**

Many automations rely on data getting added or modified a certain way in a specific application.

For instance, once a new hire gets added to your IT service management (ITSM) tool, the tool can create a predefined set of onboarding tickets for the employee. In addition, the tickets that get created can be based on the new hire’s role and they can include specific details on the employee.

Since internal application integrations allow you to move data quickly, reliably, and accurately, your applications will be able to initiate automated tasks—like the example above—on time and without issues.

[![Benefits of application integration for customer-facing use cases](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6582420069754ceec84ed937_Application%20integration%20benefits%20for%20internal%20use%20cases%20(2).webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6582420069754ceec84ed937_Application%20integration%20benefits%20for%20internal%20use%20cases%20(2).webp)

### **Increases close rates**

As prospects evaluate your product with rivals’, [they’ll likely consider](https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/digital-markets/documents/ebook-global-software-buyer-trends-survey-insights-for-2022.pdf) the integrations each of you provide.

Therefore, if you can offer more integrations, you’ll be more likely to win competitive deals.

Our own research supports this idea; when we surveyed hundreds of product managers and engineers as part of [our State of Product Integrations](https://www.merge.dev/learning/state-of-product-integrations-2024), we learned that nearly two thirds (64%) of organizations have been able to improve their close rate by offering integrations.

[![Bar chart that shows the benefits of product integrations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65822abc7f4e50bb43b4d610_0hleH_bBCHmKwC2Mc0rHMCNzJ8x1bfldvoPzeZC_N2Rktd_ORiXc17Gima5FaEW1REUf9wa_ewknM4_D8awaz7blh-QfdiGh1-LOLhXUcv7Kxgs_qnPaRDpy445ESf6Pj5QqB9R5egiwdd7T8OVyUbI.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/65822abc7f4e50bb43b4d610_0hleH_bBCHmKwC2Mc0rHMCNzJ8x1bfldvoPzeZC_N2Rktd_ORiXc17Gima5FaEW1REUf9wa_ewknM4_D8awaz7blh-QfdiGh1-LOLhXUcv7Kxgs_qnPaRDpy445ESf6Pj5QqB9R5egiwdd7T8OVyUbI.webp)

### **Raises customer retention**

As the chart above shows, product integrations can also improve customer retention. The finding makes sense, as your integrations can let clients [automatically provision/deprovision users](https://www.merge.dev/blog/automated-provisioning), access enriched analytics, and unlock additional use cases in your product.

### **Enables market expansions**

Organizations across regions, sizes, and industries tend to use a specific set of applications. For example, an SMB may be more likely to use Gusto as their HRIS, while an enterprise organization is more likely to use Workday.

Once you identify the applications your target market(s) uses and then offer integrations with these applications, you’ll be more likely to get traction in that market.
