@Merge

As 2024 comes to an end, it's been incredible to zoom out and look at the growing list of customers who trust Merge to power their integrations.

From the world's leading financial services companies to all-in-one HR products to bleeding-edge AI startups, we've loved every minute of making secure data access easy for our 13,000+ customers.

This year we’ve:

- Onboarded market-leading companies, like Remote, BambooHR, International SOS, Corpay, and Deluxe
- Helped SaaS companies, like Electric, [save hundreds of engineering hours](https://www.merge.dev/case-studies/electric)
- Added dozens of new integrations
- Opened an office in Berlin and built a go-to-market team there

As our customers moved upmarket in 2024, we've also tailored our product roadmap to meet their needs, doubling down on our existing categories and investing heavily in product quality, scalability, and security.

Here are some highlights of our product releases from the past year.

## **Security**

Data protection has always been a top priority for Merge.

We were designed from the ground up to safeguard customer and end user data in accordance with the industry’s highest standards of security and privacy, and we made several investments in security this year.

Linked Account-specific Common Model Scopes allow customers to select the Common Models and specific fields they want to sync for each Linked Account. Customers can also use a feature that’s unique to Merge, [Redacted Unmapped Data](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/8358419-what-is-redact-unmapped-data), to redact all logs and remote data for disabled fields and unmapped data.

Our very own Co-Founder and CTO, Gil Feig, helped build [Audit Trail](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/8813877-merge-audit-trail-enhancing-security-compliance), which gives our customers’ admin users visibility into actions within the Merge dashboard—making it easier to spot issues and trace them back to their source.

[![Audit Trail screenshot](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6763955e1f3a9a1c6f3603e0_676394992a5c221fbcd57e77_Audit%2520Trail.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6763955e1f3a9a1c6f3603e0_676394992a5c221fbcd57e77_Audit%2520Trail.webp)

To help our customers secure their integrations even further, we’ve made bring your own key (BOYK) available. It lets customers maintain full control of their encryption keys, and it enables them to revoke data access at any time.

## **Internationalization**

Merge has been international from day one, and 30% of our customer base is now in Europe. Our customers are also expanding internationally, so we invested accordingly in our product.

[Link Localization](https://www.merge.dev/localization) is now live to help customers onboard non-English speaking end-users to their integrations. Customers can translate Merge Link to a specific language by using [our POST link-token endpoint](https://help.merge.dev/en/articles/9612167-merge-link-localization).

We added more multi-tenant environments in Sweden and Singapore to help support our European and APAC customers. Of course, our single-tenant offering in any region of our customers’ choice continues to be a popular option as well!

Finally, we opened a Berlin office and established an amazing support team there to better support our European customers during their working hours.

[![Merge Link Localization](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6763955e1f3a9a1c6f3603dc_676394f979371918016e1e29_Screenshot%25202024-12-18%2520at%252010.37.09%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62796ab9647626cbab663f42/6763955e1f3a9a1c6f3603dc_676394f979371918016e1e29_Screenshot%25202024-12-18%2520at%252010.37.09%25E2%2580%25AFPM.webp)

## **Customizability**

For our customers that sell upmarket, we realized that customizability both in [Merge Link](https://docs.merge.dev/get-started/link/) and in the data that Merge returns is increasingly important.

To help our customers make Merge Link look like their own, they can now use their own color palette and font style (even Comic Sans!).

We also launched white-label help center guides, allowing you to add your own logo and subdomain to them. I bought the domain name integration.guide five years ago, and I’m glad that it’s finally getting put to good use. :)

This was a huge year for custom fields, and we focused heavily on [improving our Field Mapping functionality](https://www.merge.dev/blog/field-mapping-features).

We now surface how frequently data is populated for a given field in a 3rd party API and show previews of that data for a specific Linked Account and object. Our customers can also add custom fields within objects or lists.

Field Mappings are available on a Linked Account-level, integration-level, and org-wide. And if you disagree with any of our mappings, you can override them.

Anything that’s possible by building directly is possible through Merge.

‍

## **Infrastructure**

Merge has multiple engineering teams specifically dedicated to improving our infrastructure, so we can reliably sync data at scale.

Thanks to our team’s hard work, we can:

- Run concurrent syncs
- Refine how we handle and store data
- Support idempotent and asynchronous POST requests, which allows for more scalable and resilient writes
- Use integration-specific filters to only sync the data that’s necessary

We run millions of syncs every day andthe average response time for our API requests has gone down to 300 milliseconds.

## **Product quality**

Our team made **1,500+ improvements to our existing integrations in 2024**, which has saved each customer **thousands of days on maintaining integrations**.

Gil and I have always wanted Merge to be a beautiful developer experience, and we made tons of UI improvements to our dashboard to make our features more intuitive and accessible. We also consistently enhanced Merge Link to make it easier for end users to authenticate (and enjoy their experience along the way).

## **Developer experience**

We heard the feedback on our SDKs, and we doubled down on making them better.

We partnered with a company called Fern to help us launch Advanced SDKs, which are higher quality, easier to use, and allow customers to use a single SDK for any integration they want to add via Merge.

We revamped the API tester that I built back in the day, and it now allows customers to send test GET requests to both our APIs and the APIs of supported third-party platforms. This ensures that customers can test integrations to their heart’s desire before launching them.

Last but not least, we’ve added detailed code snippets of requests and responses across every endpoint we support in our Docs.

## **Use case guides**

Our customers can use Merge in so many impactful ways, but we understand that a little hand-holding might be helpful along the way.

To help any customer identify their best use cases for Merge and implement them, we built out a comprehensive catalogue of our use cases in [our Docs](https://docs.merge.dev/use-cases/). Each documented use case provides step-by-step implementation guidance so that our customers can get up and running quickly.

## **The best is yet to come for Merge and our customers**

Our customers’ passion for building the best possible platform inspires and drives us to keep improving our own. All the progress we made in 2024 is only possible because of them.

Here’s to 2025 and beyond!

“It was the same process, go talk to their team, figure out their API. It was taking a lot of time. And then before we knew it, there was a laundry list of HR integrations being requested for our prospects and customers.”
