## Let your customer easily authenticate their integration, without reading in between the lines

Onboard customers located anywhere with instructions in their language.

We’ll handle all the behind-the-scenes work.

## Globalization isn’t going anywhere

Whether you're gearing up for expansion or already serving global markets, you know the check-list of requirements needed to make a product successful in a new geography.

After all, expansion isn’t about making new landing pages or hiring more people. You also need to localize your product and integrations to meet the needs of the customers you’re serving.

## Merge provides crystal clear localization for your integrations

Merge is the only Unified API to fully incorporate dynamic end-user localization. That means every aspect of your customer’s onboarding experience is translated and maintained by Merge.

No lost context, no lost customers.

The Merge advantage

## The only unified API with end-to-end localization

### Easy onboarding

Merge Link is the way your customers onboard to and authenticate their integration in minutes. From start to finish, every screen populates with the language your customer speaks.

### Helpful error messages

Your customers make mistakes. We help fix them. Merge writes and maintains integration-specific error messages for every integration and every language we support.

### Never worry about localization maintenance

As you expand, Merge handles both adding additional languages and localizing instructions for new integrations too. As onboarding steps change, we update them — don’t worry.
